The Assembly was charged with investigating and recommending changes to improve the electoral system of the province. The body was composed of 160 citizens selected at random from throughout the province. These members met approximately every other weekend for one year to deliberate about alternative voting arrangements. After issuing their recommendations, the question would be put to the electorate-at-large in a  referendum  held concurrently with the 2005 provincial election.  Background History and Context  In 2004, 160 randomly selected residents of the province of British Columbia, Canada, participated in a bold and innovative experiment in deliberative democracy. They formed a Citizens’ Assembly whose mandate was to analyze the electoral system and, if warranted, design a new electoral law for the province. For the first time in modern history, the task of creating an electoral system was given to ordinary citizens rather than politicians or experts. Decisions about the rules of the political game — including the geographic delineation of electoral districts, rules about campaign financing, and voting systems such as plurality election and proportional representation — are frequently made by legislative bodies. One danger is that sitting legislatures will choose rules that advance their individual or party interest in re-election rather than to advance more general democratic values such as political competitiveness, diversity and voter choice, and the responsiveness of representatives.  When the province considered the question of whether to reform its electoral system from majority rule election of legislators to some form of proportional representation, the Government of British Columbia created a body called the British Columbia Citizen’s Assembly, composed of citizens from throughout the province. The hope behind the Citizens’ Assembly is that a recommendation made by ordinary citizens rather than professional politicians or political elites would produce a more fair electoral system and also be accepted as more legitimate by British Columbians.  The proposal to convene this Citizens’ Assembly was part of a package of government reforms that the Liberal party offered in its 2001 election platform. This unorthodox initiative was the party’s response to a decade of increasing dissatisfaction with the existing electoral system. In 1996, the Liberals received 42% of the vote against 39% for the New Democratic Party (NDP). The NDP, however, won a plurality of seats in the provincial legislature (39 seats compared to 33 for the Liberal Party) under this “first-past-the-post” (FPTP) electoral system. According to its rules, each electoral district (also called a “riding”) elects one representative to parliament. The candidate who wins the greatest number of votes in a district wins its seat and the other candidates (and those who voted for them) get nothing. The Liberal Party’s simultaneous popular victory and legislative defeat in 1996 underscored the difficulties of this system for many British Columbians.  Liberal leader Gordon Campbell promised to institute a Citizens’ Assembly to consider whether a change in the electoral system was needed and, if so, to design a new electoral law, should the Liberals gain power. The Liberals won in 2001 in an election that confirmed the urgency of a reform. Their 57.62% share of the popular vote granted them 77 out of 79 seats. Though the New Democratic Party won 21.56% of the vote, they controlled only two seats. The Green Party, with its 12.39% vote share, got no seats at all. The Liberals kept their promise and, in 2003, the Citizens’ Assembly was formally established.  Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  The citizens' assembly was established by the Liberal government and allocated $5.5 million in public funds. An Assembly chairman and other key staff were also appointed to carry out preparatory work necessary for the Assembly to convene in January 2004. From January to November 2004, the 160 assembly members met, in three distinct phases, to deliberate about the existing electoral system and alternatives to it. The Assembly’s mandate, however, did not include the ultimate power to select a new system. The Assembly could formulate a detailed proposal and the citizens of British Columbia—not the legislature—would have the final say through a  popular referendum .  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Though an unorthodox body, the Citizens’ Assembly was a creature of normal legislative authorization. In 2002, the newly elected provincial government appointed a former legislator and Liberal party leader to recommend a format for the assembly. Months after his report was submitted, the government appointed the assembly’s chair, and submitted a motion to the Legislature to establish the assembly. On April 2003, the motion was approved unanimously, and a special committee of the legislature was set up to monitor the set up of the assembly and its work.  The assembly would include 158 British Columbia residents (two for each riding), be staffed by a chair and secretariat, work all through the year 2004, and be granted a budget of $5.5 million to conduct this business. Premier Gordon Campbell remarked that, ""for the first time in our nation's history, we are providing voters with the opportunity to decide for themselves how we elect our MLAs — how they should elect those who sit in the legislature to represent them”.  Its enacting legislation required that, the Citizens’ Assembly ""be broadly representative of the adult population of British Columbia, particularly respecting age, gender, and geographical distribution.” There are many ways to produce a body that “represents” the whole population. The Citizens' Assembly was to be chosen through modern techniques of random selection that improve upon the ancient method of election by lot. A list of names was to be  randomly selected  from the provincial voters’ list, with an equal number drawn from the 79 ridings. An equal number of men and women were to be drawn and selection methods aimed to mirror the age distribution of citizens over 18 in the province. Participants would be paid an honorarium of $150 per day; daycare, transportation and accommodation were also provided to make it easier for people with lower incomes and those who lived far from Vancouver to participate. This Assembly, designers thought, would ensure a balance of interests and incorporate the views of ordinary citizens into basic electoral law.  The painstaking selection began in August 2003 and continued through December. First, the voter registry for each riding was updated. Then 100 males and 100 females were randomly selected from the list for each of the 79 ridings yielding a total of 15,800 names. This sample was stratified by age cohort as well as gender in each riding. The people selected in this random draw were all invited by letter to participate in selection meetings in their ridings. Due to a low response rate, additional names were drawn in some districts. In all, over 23,000 invitation letters were sent. From these, approximately 1,700 voters expressed interest in participating in the Citizens’ Assembly, and 964 ended up attending selection meetings that provided information on the assembly’s mandate and operations, on the commitment required of members, and the selection process. Of those who attended, 158 were randomly selected, one male and one female elector per district. The names of those who had participated in selection meetings but had not been drawn were kept in case the Assembly required substitutes. This process produced no aboriginal representation, and later one male and one female aboriginal citizen were added to the Assembly by random draw from those who had attended the meetings but had not been selected. At the end of this process, the Assembly was composed of 160 members and a chair who voted only in the event of a tie.  The legislative mandate aimed to create a body that would be independent as well as representative. The Citizens’ Assembly was charged with analyzing electoral models for British Columbia with the only constraint that any recommendations be consistent with the Constitution of Canada and the Westminster parliamentary system. The Citizens’ Assembly could recommend retaining the status quo or it could propose a single detailed alternative electoral system consistent with this broad constraint. By design, the  deliberations  of the Assembly were to be insulated from interference by political parties. Furthermore, the materials and experts were to be chosen so that no particular alternative received special emphasis or preference.  The Assembly had the power to propose a system, but not to make it into law. The Assembly’s recommendations were due by the end of December 2004. If it offered a new model, the proposal would be submitted to popular referendum on May 17, 2005 at the time of the provincial general election. The referendum would pass only if it received a “double-majority” approval of at least 60% of the votes cast throughout the province and a simple majority approval in at least 60% of the 79 ridings (that is, at least 50% + 1 of the votes in at least 48 ridings). Some criticized the required majority as too stringent, but others contended that a super-majority was appropriate to ratify a measure of constitutional importance and to ensure adequate support from the entire province.  Methods and Tools UsedCitizens' Assembly  — 160 participants, 158 through random selection, 2 (indigenous) through targeted recruitment  Learning phase — small group discussions/debates, large-group lecture sessions with invited experts, plenary discussions and knowledge sharing.Public HearingsWhat Went On: Process, Interaction, and ParticipationThe Learning PhaseSome political scientists devote their entire careers to understanding various voting systems and their consequences. Most members, by contrast, felt that they knew relatively little about electoral systems. As they started, they gave themselves an average of only 4.3 on a ten-point scale when asked what they knew about voting rules. Therefore, the first order of business was for the Assembly’s 160 members to master the fundamentals of this field.  During an initial “learning phase,” the Assembly convened for six weekends (Saturday and Sunday morning) from January to late March. During these meetings, experts lectured members on electoral models in large-group sessions, members met in small groups to discuss and debate what they heard and read, and then they met in plenary to share their views. Members were randomly assigned to small groups of 10-15 members each, and groups changed every weekend to favor team building.  The lecturers and topics of the learning phase were carefully selected by Assembly staff to be impartial. The curriculum plan was reviewed by a special committee of academics and experts. Canadian as well as international political scientists instructed the groups on topics such as the role of parliament, elections and the five major families of electoral systems (majority, plurality, party list, single transferable vote, and mixed). Written materials were provided to Assembly members and senior political science graduate students facilitated their small group discussions.  During this phase, important steps were taken to develop relationships, communicative norms, and esprit de corps among participants. Members stayed in a hotel adjacent to the Assembly Hall, ate all their meals together, and often organized social events when the Assembly was not in session. They were also asked to articulate the values that should guide and regulate their interactions with one another. The assembly adopted by  consensus  values such as respect of all opinions, integrity, open-mindedness and inclusivity.The Public Hearings PhaseThe learning phase was followed by a public hearings phase that ran from May to June 2004. Individual Assembly members hosted some fifty hearings across the province to listen to their fellow citizens’ opinions on electoral reform and gather feedback from the general public. Members went to some in their home area but also attended hearings in other areas to hear what people in different communities thought. In these meetings, Assembly members also heard the arguments of interest groups, advocacy organizations and political parties, ranging from the British Columbia Nurses’ Union to the B.C. Green Party. Scribes recorded these sessions and produced summaries of all presentations. Approximately 3,000 people participated in public hearings that drew anywhere from 20 to 150 participants apiece. Besides public hearings, the Assembly also received some 1,600 written submissions that members read on-line or in print. Overall, the hearings highlighted support for a more proportional system, mainly some kind of mixed member proportional (MMP) system. The status quo majoritarian system received limited support in these hearings.The Deliberation PhaseThe third and final “ deliberation  phase” of the Assembly unfolded between September and November 2004. Up until this point, members had been asked mainly to learn and then listen. In the final three short months, however, they had to develop a recommendation for the electoral system that best suited British Columbia. During deliberation, members were prompted to identify the most important values for their electoral system. Fair results, understood as proportionality between votes and seats, local representation, and voter choice emerged as the three most important values. These became the criteria that members would use to judge alternatives.  From the beginning of the deliberation phase, it was clear that few supported the status quo FPTP system and that most favored some form of proportional representation. In relatively short order, the Assembly narrowed the field to two alternatives: the single transferable vote (STV) and the mixed member proportional (MMP) system. Members then spent two weekends (one on each) developing the best version of each system for British Columbia. Under the STV system, voters don’t select just one candidate on a ballot, but rank them from most to least favorite. For each district, there is a threshold of votes above which any candidate will be elected. In case a voter’s first choice candidate is not elected, or receives enough votes to be elected in a district, his or her vote is transferred to second choice. In this way, no vote is “wasted” and results are proportional to electoral support. The MMP system combines local representation and proportionality by assigning electors multiple votes. In New Zealand’s variant, for example, each voter casts two votes. One of these elects one representative in their district with a plurality winner (as with the first-past-the-post system). The voter chooses a party with his second vote, and candidates are assigned parliamentary seats proportionally according to party lists.  The final choice came after thoughtful deliberation on the two options, and their characteristics. Throughout the deliberation phase, members gave important reasons to support their system of choice. Some favored MMP because it balances local and proportional representation, combining “the best of both worlds” and expanding voter choice. According to a member “a lot of people don’t vote for lack of choice” and a more proportional system could reduce voter apathy by allowing small parties to emerge, thus creating more options for different constituencies. MMP would be particularly beneficial for individuals who live in areas where an ideology dominates because it allows “people who have alternative views […] to voice those views.” Another argued that “there’s a better chance with MMP for women and minorities to get elected.” If MMP gives electors more option, with a district representative and a list vote, it also gives parties too much power, and uncontested seats, whereas “there is no safe seat under STV.”  Some preferred STV over MMP because it focuses more on individual candidates and “reduces party discipline.” A member in support of STV reminded the group that much of the disillusionment with politics stemmed from excessive party power: “why are we here? We are here because of the problems created by parties, not by candidates […] here’s our chance to change it.” Members of the sparsely populated northern region were especially concerned with local representation and favored STV, with its smaller districts, over MMP. Observers report that the quality of these deliberations was generally quite high. Members showed a nuanced understanding of electoral systems, acknowledged the advantages and disadvantages of both options, and tried to reduce disagreements.  After months of deliberation, the Assembly used secret ballots to tally its members’ judgments. In the first vote, the group selected the STV system over MMP (123 votes for STV against 31 for MMP). In the final vote, the overwhelming majority (146 in favor, 7 against) supported a recommendation that a referendum be put to the citizens of British Columbia that STV replace the current single-member plurality system.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In October 2004, the Assembly recommended replacing the province's existing ""First Past the Post"" (FPTP) system with a ""Single Transferable Vote"" (STV) system: this recommendation was  put to the electorate-at-large in a referendum held concurrently with the 2005 provincial election . The referendum required approval by 60% of votes and simple majorities in 60% of the 79 districts in order to pass. The referendum was held on May 17, 2005, asking BC residents to answer yes or no to the following question: “Should British Columbia change to the BC-STV electoral system as recommended by the Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform?” Although the Citizens’ Assembly was the Liberal Party premier’s initiative, only the Green Party endorsed the STV proposal. Even there, the Greens preferred MMP to STV, but preferred STV to the status quo. Gordon Campbell praised the Assembly as a process that could be employed in other areas such as health and education, but the political parties remained largely silent regarding the merits and weaknesses of the proposal.  British Columbians could learn about the Assembly’s work by watching the recordings of the Assembly’s sessions, which broadcast repeatedly over the provincial legislature’s television service. The Assembly also maintained constant communication with the media, and had a continually updated website, which, by November 2004, had attracted over 47,000 visitors from 148 countries. In March 2005, a “NO” coalition formed, comprising personalities from across the political spectrum, to counter the “YES” coalitions (which included a group formed by former Assembly members). Despite these public information campaigns, polling evidence suggested that by the time of the referendum, about half of British Columbia voters were unaware of the referendum.  Although many voters reported limited knowledge of the referendum question on the days preceding the vote, the STV proposal nearly passed. It won by simple majority in 77 out of 79 ridings, easily passing one hurdle of the double super-majority requirement. But it won 57.4% of the total votes cast, falling a few points short of the required 60%. This result surprised many media observers who predicted that the STV proposal would clearly lose. A majority of votes, albeit close to the required percentage, was not enough to scrap the current system. The leaders of the three major parties, the Liberals, the NDP and the Greens, all agreed that the referendum results clearly signaled the public’s discontent. As Premier Gordon Campbell remarked, ""There's a real hunger to move and look at ways of improving our system […] I've been a clear advocate of that and I'm going to look at that in different ways in the future."" The NDP leader proposed that a new Citizens’ Assembly should look at a new model; others suggested that the legislature should examine the issue. Many other Canadian provinces started working on electoral reform, and  Ontario launched a similar citizen assembly , led by a judge and followed by a referendum.  In September 2005, the government committed to re-submit the STV system to a referendum in November 2008, so that a possible new system could be used for the 2009 provincial elections. Cognizant of some of the reasons that led to the referendum’s defeat, the Liberal government promised funding for opponents and supporters of the STV system to make the cases for and against before the public of British Columbia. In addition, the government asked the Electoral Boundaries Commission to provide a map of ridings under the proposed STV system. Furthermore, the wording of the 2008 referendum question was to be crafted by government and debated by the legislature. But owing to the costs of holding a separate election as well as to accommodate the work schedule of the Electoral Boundaries Commission, the government delayed the referendum until May 2009, when it could be combined with the general election. This time the province's voters defeated the STV proposal with only 38.82% voting in favour.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Though the Citizens’ Assembly ingeniously delegated important powers to ordinary citizens, it also attracted some criticisms regarding its design and operation. Random selection of members was meant to make the body representative of the public at large, but citizens were not obliged to participate, as they are in  legal juries . Instead, they were free to decline, so it is likely that many of the members who accepted were more active and civic-minded than the population at large. Participating in the Assembly might also have been more appealing to reformists than to those who were satisfied with the status quo. The selection process insured equal representation by geography, gender, and age group, but not ethnicity, aboriginal status, or socio-economic status. If the selection criteria granted equal representation to men and women, why should it not also ensure that also the voices of disadvantaged groups or of citizens of specific ethnic origin be represented? Finally, it remains unclear whether members felt they were representing their personal views, their districts, what emerged from the hearings, or the province at large. Would the Assembly have made different decisions with different selection mechanisms and notions of representation?  In terms of equality of the deliberations, inevitably, some members spoke more than others, with interventions from men outnumbering those of women or minorities. Although the chair encouraged first-time speakers to engage, more formal inclusion rules could have levelled the playing field for all participants.  Other critics suspect that the process of deliberation was consciously or unconsciously steered by staff. Members composed neither the structure of the Assembly’s  deliberations , its timing, nor its agenda. Staff decisions regarding these factors, as well as the educational materials and the selection of experts who spoke to Assembly members, may have biased their deliberations. Additionally, members had no choice over the priorities of reform, but were restricted by their mandate to focus solely on the electoral law, neglecting other important elements, such as electoral districts, or campaign finance.  The deliberation phase was particularly complicated because the Assembly mandate required that the different options that had been explored in previous phases had to be narrowed down and eventually coalesce into one proposal. The process of selecting the desirable characteristics of a model, for example, was hastened and issues such as women representation received less attention than some wished. The group ended up selecting the three characteristics that were at the top of the lecturer’s list of desirable features of electoral models. Similarly, it was unclear whether the Assembly had the authority to modify the number of electoral districts and the number of parliamentary seats, which would have been required to adopt the MMP system. The Assembly chair clarified that the number of seats could not be altered, which might have prompted members to select the STV system because it required less change. It appears that more time was devoted to illustrating the STV system, while the technical details of applying the MMP model to British Columbia were left unexplored. The tension between exploring options and reaching consensus around a model emerged during the deliberation phase, and it remains unclear whether members would have favored the MMP system had they had more time to work through its complexities.  In the end, the referendum, although supported by a substantial majority of the population, did not pass. Perhaps it did not deserve to pass. Despite its potential problems, there is little doubt that the deliberations of the Assembly were rich and serious. The larger public debate about the STV proposal was anemic by comparison. Although the government provided Assembly members with ample opportunities to become experts in electoral systems, it did not make a comparable investment to educate the general public before the referendum. For the most part, political parties and politicians did not engage this quasi-constitutional question. Despite this deafening silence, the majority of citizens voted against the very system that elected their government. After that popular rebuke, one observer remarked, “the real deliberation will begin.”  See AlsoCitizens' AssemblyBritish Columbia Referendum on Electoral Reform (2005)References  Mark Warren and Hillary Pearse eds.

The NRP represented a procedural innovation, with a focus on empowering local residents to set priorities, design projects, and undertake implementation.  Although the downtown Minneapolis commercial area was experiencing a boom in the late 1980s, many inner-city neighborhoods were facing serious decline. Residents were leaving inner-city areas in response to dilapidated housing stock, deteriorating school quality and increasing crime rates.  The NRP was initiated after the election of a new administration in the 1984 city election, a result attributed in part to the mobilization of neighborhood constituencies. The purpose of the NRP was to stem and reverse the residential exodus, by means of delegating revitalization planning and authority to residents. It was anticipated that this process would improve the design and delivery of public services, improve cooperation between city agencies, increase the capacity of local residents and revitalize the social fabric of the area.  Background History and Context  Mounting political pressure to improve the city's residential areas derived from the increasingly stark contrast between the booming downtown commercial area and the degraded neighborhoods.  Following the change in administration after the 1984 city election, an emerging coalition of new council members and mobilized local constituencies organized a series of task forces to investigate the causes and possible solutions to the evident urban decay. This diagnostic work predicted over $3 billion would be needed to fund a serious revitalization program. As this amount significantly exceeded the city's budget for revitalization work, councilors and constituents began to consider how delegated planning authority might better leverage the energies and abilities of the residents themselves.  Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  The Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP) was established as a joint initiative by the Minnesota state legislature and the Minneapolis city council in 1990. $20 million a year was dedicated to the project over a 20-year period (in two equal ten-year phases), bringing the total dedicated funding to $400 million.  Funds for the NRP were generated from tax increment financing (TIF) on the downtown commercial district, rather than from dedicated funds in the city budget.  Funding was provided by the NRP to all 81 neighborhoods regardless of economic status, as a strategy to foster inclusion and a basis for political support across the city. A progressive allocation formula was developed to ensure funds were allocated where they are most needed.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Most of the planning work was undertaken by individuals elected in each neighborhood to the NRP's steering committee. In conjunction with the local neighborhood organizations, the steering committee set up outreach and consultative activities to identify issues that needed to be addressed.  Neighborhoods were divided into three categories according to level of deprivation: a)  protection neighborhoods  were judged relatively better off and in no immediate danger of tipping b)  revitalization neighborhoods  were judged substantially sound, but at risk of decline without intervention c)  redirection areas  were judged already in decline and needed stronger intervention.  In order to participate in the NRP, neighborhoods were required to establish a resident organization as a 501c(3) corporation to coordinate planning, oversee the implementation of projects and work with city departments. Neighborhoods were also required to formulate a “Participation Agreement” with the NRP central office that set out how community engagement would take place.  Methods and Tools UsedKnow what methods or tools were used? Help uscomplete this section! What Went On: Process, Interaction, and ParticipationInitial OutreachThe NRP steering committee worked in conjunction with local neighborhood organizations to set up outreach activities for the identification of issues that need to be addressed.  Advice was solicited from residents through mail-in  surveys , face-to-face meetings, and  focus groups  with underrepresented groups (including the elderly, minorities, renters, youth, and business representatives).Neighborhood Action Plans (NAPs)Steering committees were required to detail how specific projects would meet residents’ needs and priorities, as well as costs and how these will be covered in a ""Neighborhood Action Plan"" (NAP). NAPs typically also addressed how identified costs would be covered (for example, through program funds, volunteer labor or the leveraging of additional resources.)  As a rule, NAPs were drafted in close collaboration/negotiation with city departments to ensure feasibility, costs, and timing assessments are accurate. Indeed, interested agencies often contributed funding from their own budgets to support the process of NAP development.Vetting and Approval of NAPsNAPs were first vetted and approved at the local general neighborhood meeting. After this stage, they were then passed to the central NRP office and city council for final approval and resource appropriation.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  On average, the NAP planning phase lasted 3.2 years from inception to final plan approval. During this period, resident volunteers were required to familiarize themselves with a range of technical and substantive skill sets, including knowledge of city rules, negotiation strategies and co-ordination skills. Residents were encouraged to stay involved during the implementation phase of the projects outlined in each NAP by monitoring the city departments contracted to complete these projects.  As of 1999, a total of 4775 home improvement grants and loans were released to home owners under the NRP. 675 rental units were built or renovated.  Homeownership rates in Minneapolis increased, especially in neighborhoods classified in the ""redirection"" designation. In addition, housing prices increased from 1990-92 to 1996-98 across all neighborhood types, most especially in the ""protection"" category.  Overall, the next largest city-wide spending category after housing was economic development (over $22 million), which included funds for: enhancing streetscapes, parking improvements, activities to revitalize commercial corridors, and the creation of new businesses and employment for residents.  The NRP also strengthened neighborhood organizations across the city by providing them with funding and an institutionalized role in planning. Many organizations began to operate with paid staff out of dedicated offices.  City-wide, residents reported an enhanced sense of community and civic spirit.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Some critics have argued that NRP unfairly favors homeowners [...] However, Fagatto and Fung argue that as a portion of investment, this impression may be exaggerated because many homeowner-oriented expenditures passed through revolving loan funds where initial allocations were repaid and reinvested as new loans several times over.[1]  Others have referred to the NRP as ""a white homeowners’ thing"" because of the predominant role of this section of the community in the neighborhood organizations. Ultimately, given the long timeframes and amount of volunteer time required, it appears elected committee membership was more attractive to permanent residents with an existing capital investment in the neighborhood.  Elected committee membership also required a relatively high level of ""skilling up"" for new members, with skills difficult to transfer between participants. Informal expertise could conceivably have created substantial barriers to new participants.  Finally, given small proportion of active participants exercising delegated authority, may question legitimacy of decisions made by elected committee members.

Although the 2005 President of China, Hu Jintao, had vowed never to adopt a “Western-style democracy,"" mounting political unrest meant that discussions to democratize local public policymaking appeared vital to maintain the Communist Party’s authority. [1]  Some of the projects to be considered included new bridges, roads, a new school, and city gardens. In total, the projects were estimated to cost around 136 million yuan (US $17 million), but due to a change in government policy, only an estimated 40 million yuan (US $5 million) could be spent on urban planning and infrastructure. [2]A working committee of party officials from both Wenling City and Zeguo district identified deliberative and consultative meetings as a potential channel for citizens and interest groups to express their preferences in prioritizing these proposed development projects. With the technical advice of Professors James Fishkin (Stanford University) and Baogang He (Deakin University), they applied  Deliberative Polling  in a one-day event as a means of deciding which infrastructure projects could be funded during the upcoming fiscal year. [3]Background History and Context  The Wenling City Deliberative Poll of 2005 is one of a number of consultative and deliberative experiments that have taken place across China. Beginning in the mid-1990s, many villages began developing representative meetings in which major decisions on village affairs were discussed and deliberated upon by village representatives. [4]  This local public hearing system has gradually spread into urban communities with residents beginning to voice consultative input in local decision-making processes. In the Shangcheng district of Hangzhou City, for instance, a ‘ consensus conference ’ or ‘consultative meeting’ is held regularly once a month. [5]Before the Deliberative Poll, Wenling City was already known to be another leading example of consultative practices. From 1996 to 2000, Wenling City officials have held more than 1,190 deliberative and consultative meetings at the village level, 190 at the township level, and 150 in governmental organizations, schools, and the business sector. [6]  As a result of its commitment to good governance, the city won the national prize for Innovations and Excellence in Local Chinese Governance in 2004. In this context, the Deliberative Polling project in Zeguo was seen as being the next step in a series of participatory experiments being conducted throughout Wenling City.  Prior to this, most budgeting decisions were bureaucratically dominated by the Chinese Communist Party’s leaders. Even the previous deliberative experiments have been critiqued as allowing for domination by policy elites and potential manipulation of dialogue to support predetermined conclusions in favour of business interests. Moreover, the processes were demonstrably unrepresentative of the Zeguo Township population of 240,000. [7]Zeguo gained its rapid economic development through their vibrant private economy, which revolves around a major manufacturing sector to support the construction industry. [8]  Growing local pressures by this wealthy private sector helped lead the local government of Zeguo to require deliberative, consultative budgeting mechanisms to help prioritise the city’s projects. [9]  A more positive motivation for the coming of the First Chinese Deliberative Poll relates to how it would increase the public spiritedness as shared discussions regarding public issues insinuate greater support for projects that would benefit the entire town. [10]Most importantly, the idea of the deliberative poll was required because the local government of Zeguo Township had recognised that it would cost RMB 137,000,000 to fund 30 projects for the city which is outside of their budget (RMB 40,000,000) therefore they required the public to decide on which 10 projects they should fund. [11]  To add to this, it was a binding deliberation and so the end goal includes funding provided for the most important projects. [12]  Surprisingly, although this is China’s First Deliberative Poll, they are the first since Ancient Athens to implement governmental policies and decisions with the use of their Deliberative Poll results. [13]Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  A working committee and expert panel were both formed in December 2004 to undertake the launch of the Deliberative Poll. Notable participants in the working committee included Wenling City’s Deputy Party Secretary Dai Kangnian, Officer Chen Yiming, Zeguo Party Secretary Jiang Zhaohua, and Zeguo Deputy Party Secretary Wang Xiaoyu. [14]  Jiang Zhaohua advocated for the idea as he believed that it would reduce elite dominance as well as the likelihood of social instability by bringing the people and leaders closer together. [15]The working committee was tasked with acting as liaisons with selected participants, undertaking the logistics of the Poll itself, and selecting the panel of experts who would carry out preliminary studies of all the proposed infrastructure projects. The information provided by the expert panel formed the bulk of the briefing information provided to each participant prior to the start of the poll. In addition, Professors James Fishkin (Stanford University) and Baogang He (Deakin University) were asked to assist local officials in preparing the questionnaires, briefing materials, and ensure that both were unbiased, accessible, and balanced. Significant revisions to both the materials and questionnaires were made throughout March 2005 under Fishkin and He’s guidance. [16]The Deliberative Poll was funded by the Zeguo Township local government, totalling the cost of RMB 100,000 [17]  which effectively helped them to focus on 10 well-deliberated projects for urban planning, environmental and infrastructure construction with the use of their RMB 40,000,000 budget.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  Zeguo Township in Wenling City has a permanent population of around 119,200 and a migrant population estimated at 120,000. Of this entire population, 275 people were selected to participate. Selection of potential participants for the Deliberative Poll was done through a process of random sampling from a household registration list.The participants were incentivised to attend the Deliberation Day including RMB 50, free lunch and travel. [18]  Official channels of newspapers and notice boards were used to further widen participation. [19]  It was hoped that, by using random sampling, the Poll would include a diverse and fairly representative microcosm of the views of the general population – both those who are active in politics and disengaged from the process. [20]  This feature was also a core element to achieve the experiment's aim of preventing elites from dominating. [21]Methods and Tools Used  This event usedparticipatory budgeting  as its main methodology although this was executed using theDeliberative Polling  method. Deliberative Polling involves various tools of engagement includingsurveys  (before and after),  question and answer periods with experts , small groupdeliberation , and plenary discussion.  Overall, the process enabled participants to witness competing opinions and become better informed about policies to help formulate and express an opinion in their final confidential questionnaire. [22]What Went On: Process, Interaction, and Participation  Deliberative Polling is intended to create a representative sample of what public opinion might be if all citizens were given the chance to become more informed. In March 2005, selected participants were asked to complete a questionnaire before any briefing information was distributed to them. In the questionnaire, participants were asked to rate the thirty proposed infrastructure projects on a 0 to 10 scale (where 0 is unimportant and 10 is very important). [23]  There were also 4 questions to interpret the participants’ general knowledge of the Zeguo Township policy context, such as what the floating population count was (by which the questions answered correctly increased by 11% in the final questionnaire). [24]  Once all questionnaires had been returned, the participants were given both information about each project and a chance to deliberate their preferences with one another. Of the 275 people initially selected in the random sample, 269 completed the first questionnaire and 235 showed up on the day of deliberations to complete the poll. [25]On April 9, 2005, the participants were given balanced briefing documents and divided randomly into sixteen discussion groups of sixteen participants, each of which was facilitated by a trained moderator. Whereas in previous consultative meetings local party officials had chaired deliberative meetings, the moderators were schoolteachers; they were selected from Zeguo Number Two High School and trained by Fishkin and He in the month leading up to the meetings on how to hide their personal opinions, foster equal, civil discussion and facilitate the process of forming questions.  The day alternated small group discussions and plenary sessions in which questions from the small groups were answered from competing perspectives. In their groups, participants were asked to carefully examine the thirty proposed infrastructure projects, discuss merits and drawbacks, and identify key questions that they wished to pose to competing panels of 12 experts during a plenary session. At the end of the day, the participants were then asked to complete an identical questionnaire to the one they had filled out previously: ranking the thirty proposed projects and commenting on the quality of information provided to them. [26]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Following the day of deliberation, the ranked preferences of participants changed significantly from the initial questionnaires. Among the highest rated projects, support from participants increased markedly for three sewage treatment plants, producing a plan for the overall city design, extensive repairs to the village’s principal road, and the construction of a ‘Citizen’s Park’. Support decreased for a number of other projects, including a number of minor roads and maintenance to an already existing public park. In addition to their options on policy choices, the participants had also been asked a series of questions about Zeguo and its economic situation to assess their general knowledge of public issues. Over the course of deliberations, responses on the four knowledge questions posed showed an average increase of 8.9% (excluding one question – deemed confusing – that asked respondents to identify a product not produced in Zeguo). [27]Crucial to the success of the Wenling Deliberative Poll was whether or not the ranked preferences of participants would have any impact on the policymaking process. The results of the Poll were officially presented to Zeguo’s local People’s Congress on April 30, 2005 by Professor Fishkin and Jiang Zhaohua for further debate and deliberation. [28]  In Congress, a majority of the people’s deputies voted for the Democratic Poll’s top twelve projects and the Zeguo town government implemented this decision. [29]  The chosen projects were more environmental-related after deliberation (such as sewage treatment and road construction which affects everyone’s daily lives) [30]  rather than ‘flashy’ prestige projects like building parks or bridges. [31]Moreover, since the experimental project, it has influenced other local governments in Beijing to discuss in their public hearing meetings to see whether deliberative polling would work in their bigger cities which had a larger majority of the Chinese middle class. [32]  As a result, China has had 4 deliberative polls since the Zeguo Township for other infrastructure projects and the entire town’s budgeting plans. [33]Analysis and Lessons Learned  This experiment revealed that a balance of power between the local government and its citizens is possible, and that citizens should play a key role in important decision-making. [34]  The process also involved a formal evaluation of the entire process to which the participants’ key feedback included how they felt that the time spent was valuable, how everyone’s views were considered equally, and that the moderator made no attempt to influence others with their views. [35]  Although well received by both local officials and participating citizens, the use of Deliberative Polling techniques did meet with some obstacles during the experiment. First, the cost is a significant issue for other municipalities in China to consider in trying to replicate the event. Zeguo spent over 100, 000 yuan (US $12,000) on the event – something that may be beyond poorer areas of the country. [36]  In addition, selected participants were given a heavy workload, which when combined with the time needed for citizens to participate may deter officials from using Polling techniques on anything but the most important of public issues. Finally, local practitioners tended to use simplified and informal methods, skip over required procedures, and cut short the time given to deliberative sessions.  In comparison to previous public consultations in Wenling, the Deliberative Poll was seen as a significant improvement on past consultative meetings and a viable template for future deliberations. In the past, the sample size necessary to create an accurate representation of the public was thought to need the support and participation of local elites such as people’s deputies, village committee members, and village representatives. Not only did heavy involvement from an elite few render the sample of the population questionable, but it also raised the possibility of manipulating public deliberation and the mobilization of participants chosen exclusively by officials. The random selection method utilized in Zeguo was intended to overcome perceptions of manipulation and allow for an accurate sample of the views of the entire local community.  However, this experiment has been criticized as not being as representative as it seems because 130,000 migrant workers in Zeguo Township were excluded. [37]  In addition, the random selection process has been deemed inadequate as there was a systematic overrepresentation of men resulting from a failure to implement one important customary element of Deliberative Polling - random selection within the household. [38]  But since then, Chinese Deliberative Polls have corrected this mistake and replaced it with sampling individuals from the electoral list instead. [39]Previous consultative meetings also did not provide enough background information to participants prior to deliberation. In contrast, a team of twelve experts specifically designed the briefing materials used in the Zeguo Poll. Fishkin and He helped them revise these materials so that they were well balanced and accessible, and clearly communicated the pros and cons for each proposed infrastructure project. [40]  This allowed participants to accurately convey their views to party officials and also allowed officials greater confidence in ‘representativeness’ of the views being conveyed. While officials had previously used anecdotal evidence to praise the success of past consultative meetings, there was no way of ascertaining the actual impact they had upon participant preferences. By allowing for a comparison of participants’ questionnaires from before and after partaking in deliberations, an accurate set of statistical figures was generated. For policymakers going forward with the Poll’s recommendations, this gave the twelve projects selected by participants sound empirical support for reflecting the informed preferences of the community.  Several structural features of the Poll were also singled out for praise. [41]  In particular, the Poll was able to balance the trade-offs between having a higher number of participants and a lower quality of deliberation at a single event. By alternating between small meetings and plenary sessions, the benefits of small group discussions were spread out over a relatively large body of participants. In the meetings themselves, the use of trained moderators was also beneficial. Moderators were advised on how to ensure an equal opportunity for each participant to articulate their preferences and on how to prevent domination of the discussion by a few. Having the moderators be selected from the local high school also ensured that officials attending the Poll were not allowed to overhear deliberations or speak out to influence the choices of citizens participating.  Despite recognizing some problems many scholars – most notably Fishkin and He – have not hesitated in labeling the Poll a success and framing it as an important step on the path to institutional reform in China. Having seen several benefits from the process, Zeguo officials have scheduled a similar Deliberative Poll for subsequent fiscal years. In 2008, a greater range of budgetary issues were added to the agenda for deliberation. [42]See AlsoDeliberative PollingCenter for Deliberative DemocracyReferences[1]  Jakes, S. (2005).

They formed a Citizens’ Forum with eight committees (each with circa 45 participants) whose task was to complete an agenda on the future of Europe. The European Union has often been criticized as an opaque, technocratic institution so this Citizens' Forum was designed to engage EU citizens in the process of deliberating and deciding on their shared priorities for the Europe they would like to see. Within their discussions, they defined the European Union’s future challenges and developed possible solutions taking into consideration how European citizens themselves can contribute to these developments.  At the beginning of the process in February 2009, all the participants met in Berlin. Together the eight committees framed the basis for the subsequent online deliberation by defining Europe’s main challenges on which they would like to work. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, attended the event as a guest. During an eight-week online deliberation, the participants reviewed and checked their original ideas, examining the most persuasive points and compiling a citizens’ programme consisting of 16 resolutions. In April 2009, the participants met again, this time in the old German parliament building in Bonn, and discussed their demands with five European Parliament candidates.  Background History and Context  While new potential member states are still attracted to the European Union, its allure for citizens of the current member states is fading. European citizens seem to take the achievements of a unified Europe for granted: open borders, a common currency, peace and freedom. The European Union seems to have a good track record. Nevertheless, many EU citizens cannot relate to these developments and are afraid of uncertainties: What does the future hold for Europe? Will the European Union protect its citizens? Or will the Union further advance globalization, which many European citizens already perceive as a threat? And eventually, how democratic will the European Union be?  “Europe doesn’t make us dream anymore”, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, said after the failed  referendum  on the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands. Brussels decides upon the citizens’ daily lives but they feel frustrated and powerless in relation to this elite-driven political sphere. In February 2009, only 30% of the European population knew how they were going to cast their votes for the new European Parliament in June 2009, while 62% did not even know that the elections were going to be held. The dominant picture of European governance is one of a top-down, opaque and technocratic process involving domestic civil servants and EU officials in a closed policy network, rather than a transparent process of deliberation and decision-making, open to broad participation by all those with a stake in the outcome. In fact, beyond formalities of parliamentary elections, the EU has not been able to develop an engaged public sphere for debating its future. This is where the Citizens’ Forum Europe comes in. The Citizens’ Forum is a new form of participation developed by the Bertelsmann Foundation, the Ludwig-Erhard Foundation and the  Heinz Nixdorf  Foundation. It is a 6-8 week online deliberation embedded in two live events, one at the beginning of the process and the other one at the end.GermanyIn 2007 the “Intitiative Soziale Marktwirtschaft” founded by the  Bertelsmann  Foundation, the Ludwig-Erhard-Foundation and the Nixdorf Foundation, resulted from two  surveys  on the social market system that demonstrated that there is a wide gap between the views of political representatives and the perceptions of German citizens regarding the current economic model. Whereas 60% of the German politicians characterised the economic allocation as fair, less than a third of the German population did so. This led the “Inititative Soziale Marktwirtschaft” to the conclusion that there was a need for dialogue between citizens and decision makers.  Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  A team within the  Bertelsmann Foundation  developed an innovative online platform that facilitates deliberation between 300-400 participants. At the end of this process, the plenary approves a written text, which claims to be normative and qualified: 16 challenges and 16 possible solutions to meet these challenges.  The first citizens’ programme on the future of the social market economy in Germany was published on its 60th anniversary. As a result of the success of the first edition of the Citizens’ Forum in 2008, the Bertelsmann Foundation and the Nixdorf Foundation increased their funding for the development of this participatory project and decided to run a second edition: the Citizens’ Forum on Europe’s future which started in autumn 2008.  The Citizens’ Forum was implemented by  Zebralog  and  Binary Objects , who took care of the planning, setup and moderation of the online deliberation, and IKU, who was responsible for the live event in Berlin. The whole process has been evaluated by the  European Institute for Public Participation  (EIPP).  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The project was designed so that the dialogue would be based on a balanced agenda, incorporating the diverse views and interests within German society. Hence, the citizens involved in this deliberation process had to represent the German population with respect to certain criteria: age, gender, education and geographical distribution. The organisers decided for a random selection by means of the Gabler-Häder design, a selection frame developed at ZUMA (Zentrum für Umfragen, Methoden und Analysen). This includes telephone numbers that are both listed in the telephone directory and those without listings which can be called from a local network. The recruitment was carried out by the Bamberger Centrum für Emprische Sozialforschung (BACES) through a multilevel process. The list of potential participants consisted of 40,000 telephone numbers. Taking the four selection criteria into consideration, around 2,000 people expressed an interest in the process. All received information material by post on the process, the initiators and the participants already recruited. Those still interested were asked to complete an online questionnaire to check if they were able to work online. 361 citizens were selected to participate in the Citizens’ Forum Europe and were subsequently divided into smaller working committees. The recruitment phase lasted from October to November 2008.  Methods and Tools Used  This initiative used both face-to-face and  online deliberation . The first online event included an introduction of participants, information sharing, and  question and answer with experts . This was followed by a face-to-face event where small group deliberations took the form of  thematic dialogue tables . As well, representatives from each committee were involved in a Q&amp;A with Chancellor Merkel.  The majority of  deliberation was online  using the software “discoursemachine 5” by  Binary Objects  and was moderated by  Zebralog . In contrast to classic online forums, the Citizens’ Forum consists of special workflows, which enable hundreds of people to work together efficiently. So-called “Citizen Editors”, that is participants elected by the members of a committee, are the only ones allowed to revise the solutions discussed by the committee and the plenary. Whereas every participant has the opportunity to comment, the Citizen Editors — who are required to work circa one hour per day — have to assure the balance between a variety of sometimes contradictory opinions. They are responsible for condensing a vast amount of comments into a single concrete conclusion. An audit trail of every single revision of the text guarantees the transparency in this dynamic editorial process. Professional online-moderators support the Citizen Editor with a view to fostering inclusive and balanced participation. In order to avoid getting lost in the editorial process, every participant has their own task manager, which structures the discussion and defines the time needed to fulfil the task. Thus, the whole editorial process is entirely in the citizens’ hands.  The final event was again face-to-face and involved plenary and small-group  deliberation  as well as  Q&amp;A with political representatives . It ended in majoritarian voting.  What Went On: Process, Interaction, and ParticipationThe Preparatory PhaseBefore meeting face-to-face for first time in Berlin in February 2009, the participants of the Citizens’ Forum Europe met virtually in November 2008 on the online platform www.buergerforum2009.de. There, they had the opportunity to obtain information on the whole participatory process, the facilitators, the organisers, and, in particular, the complex functioning of the European Union. Different modes of information were offered on the website: 27 articles including comics, photos, graphics and videos.  In addition to the general information on the European Union, two experts per committee introduced themselves to the participants and gave them their personal views on the committees’ topics. The topics were: Europe’s identity - culture and education; Europe’s resources - climate and energy; Europe’s population - migration and demography; Europe’s internal market – economy and finances; Social Europe – solidarity, cohesion and justice; Democracy in Europe – constitution and institutions; Europe’s state of law – civil rights and internal security; Europe in the world – foreign policy and security. The experts were chosen by the Bertelsmann Foundation. Their task was to give advice whenever they were asked by the participants. In fact, their role was more passive than active. Nevertheless, they had to ensure that the participants’ proposed solutions fit in the framework of the overall discussion about Europe’s future, that is that they were not based on factually wrong premises. Overall, this preparation helped enable the participants to become acquainted with the online facilities of the process. First online discussions took place among the participants and the online moderators introduced themselves as guardians of the discussion rules and as the contact person for questions raised by the participants.The Live Event in BerlinFrom the 13th-14th of February 2009, 361 citizens from all over Germany travelled to the German capital, Berlin. Here they met face-to-face for the first time. The aim of the two-day live event was to get to know each other, in particular within the committees, and to establish an agenda for the online-deliberation process. In the morning session of the 13th February, the work in the committees started. Since the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, arrived about noon, the first task of each committee was to work out three answers for the questions the chancellor had previously asked the body of the Citizens’ Forum. In addition, the committees had to gather questions, which the elected representatives from each committee had to discuss with the chancellor at a  round table .  After the visit of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the committees dedicated their remaining time of the two days to their “real” task. They discussed, with the help of a professional moderator, the topic of the committee and the future challenges on this field. After having agreed on two challenges, they brainstormed possible solutions how to tackle them.  In addition to this work on the agenda of the citizens’ programme on the future of Europe, the participants chose two Citizen Editors per challenge who were responsible for developing solutions with the help of the committee. In order to prepare for the ongoing online deliberation, the online skill of each participant was developed in a personal online training session provided by a special trainer. A comprehensive session on the functions of the online platform also helped to allay any fear of technology, especially for those not having a great deal of experience with the new technology and its applications. In order to set the conditions of community building after such a short period of personal exchange, the facilitators took a photo of each participant and tried to guarantee a structure which made it possible to easily recognize each other on the online platform.The Online-DeliberationThe online deliberation phase started immediately after the live event in Berlin. Back at home the first thing to do according to the individual task manager on the platform was to comment online on the event in Berlin and to check out the profiles of fellow participants who met in Berlin. In addition, every participant could find photos of the flip charts discussed within the committees and the texts which the Citizen Editor produced on both challenges identified by the committee. The texts covered the two challenges of Europe’s future defined by each committee and the respective solution statements were also available.  The two challenges were addressed during the online deliberation in two successive phases, 30 days per phase. The participants themselves chose which of the challenges they preferred to start the discussion with. Just as in Berlin, the deliberation process was supported by professional online moderators and by the experts whose task was to give advice when asked for by the participants.  During the first ten days, the participants had the possibility to comment on and further develop the solution statements on the first challenge. Meanwhile all the committee members had to vote for the solution statement they most supported. After the first ten days the voting results decided which solution statements the members of the committee would like to have included in the citizens’ programme. During the next ten days, the Citizen Editor had to develop the solution statement into a formal solution considering financial and social costs. On average, each Citizen Editor revised their solution at least 15 times.  Thereafter, every committee presented its solution to the whole body of the Citizens’ Forum for rating. The same procedure was repeated once again with the second set of challenges. Although the online deliberation was a long and ongoing process, the participation was high: 96% of the participants wrote comments and 80% to 90% participated in the online votes and rankings. All in all about 10,000 comments were gathered during the online discussion, of which, 7,355 related to the debate on the solutions. The impressive output of the online deliberation phase was a citizens’ programme including 16 challenges and 16 possible solutions on the future of Europe.The Citizens’ Summit in BonnOn the 25th and 26th of April 2009, the whole body of the Citizens’ Forum met in Bonn in the plenary of the former German Parliament building. The aim of this reunion was to approve the citizens’ programme on the future of Europe as a whole, for which the participants voted with an absolute majority. In addition, the citizens approved, together with the facilitators, a ten-point plan to promulgate their ideas and to launch dialogue with the politicians. They agreed on a division of tasks and responsibilities: five points were to be completed by the facilitators and five points were to be carried out by the citizens themselves. Amongst the actions were: two delegations to Berlin and Brussels, the continuation of media relations on regional and local level, an online supported election appeal by the participants for the European Parliamentary Election, the distribution of the citizens’ programme to the German representatives in the German and European parliaments as well as to relevant European stakeholders, appointments with local politicians and stakeholders, etc. The summit in Bonn gave the participants the first opportunity to discuss their programme with politicians. Five members of each political group represented in the European Parliament were invited to discuss the demands formulated in the programme. Every representative from the European Parliament was asked, in preparation of the summit, to comment on at least one of the solutions proposed by the Citizens’ Forum.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The most obvious and measurable outcome is the citizens’ programme itself: 16 challenges and 16 solutions on the future of Europe covering more than 40 pages. In contrast to the image of the European citizen, depicted by the national media, as a group who do not want to grant the European Union more power, the participants of the Citizens’ Forum propose to nurture the voice of the European Union. They support a real European government, elected by the European Parliament. In addition, they want the European Union to speak with one voice in international institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and are in favour of a reform of the international finance market. Regarding the harmonisation of finances, they would also like to see a unifying tax system in order to reduce tax avoidance and tax evasion. To help close the gap between the European Union and the European people, they propose to invest in transnational education initiatives and to put more effort into political transparency.  The media coverage of the Citizens’ Forum was mainly regional and local. Their focus was to portray around 80 participants of the Citizens’ Forum rather than to report on the participatory process. The media coverage on the national level was rather low and limited mainly to the presence of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, at the live event in Berlin. Online media did not report the Citizens’ programme. There are only around ten comments on political blogs about the whole process.The Citizens’ programme was distributed to all German MEPs and elected members of the German parliament working on European Affairs as well as other relevant stakeholders. This was accompanied by a letter with an invitation to contact participants of the Citizens’ Forum. More than 60 participants out of the 361 took advantage of the opportunity of a personal conversation with (mainly local) politicians.  Beside the appointments with MPs and MEPs, 65% of the participants affirmed that they want to actively promote the citizens’ programme in their own peer-group, within local organisations and institutions, such as schools, unions or city council.  Answering the question on the results achieved by the Citizens’ Forum, political mobilisation of the participants seems to be the strongest point. The participants formed their thoughts on the topics at hand in a very intense way. Whether and to what extent the process fostered the democratic skills of the participants is to be proven (by an ongoing PhD dissertation).  Another finding is that online deliberation is possible even among people with different levels of proficiency with technology. The online platform enables citizens from very diverse social and educational backgrounds to work together in a way that suits their individual style and ability. Asynchronous workflows facilitate this: slow thinkers get the time they need, while fast thinkers can skip things as they please. Having said this, the process also has to be synchronous: mutual decisions have to be made and the result must be achieved within 10 weeks. All this can be done with participation quotas of over 80% – however professional online moderation is vital.  The platform allows hundreds of people to work together on standard texts and to achieve structural qualified results, similar to parties’ manifests. Related web 2.0 tools are, by now, mostly restricted to descriptive texts and facts (e.g. Wikipedia) where normative decisions are less important. The workflows of the Citizens’ Forum, however, proved that the generation of a text, for which normative decisions within a group of people are necessary, can be conducted online.  Even though the involvement of politicians was at a low, almost negligible level, some politicians have showed a strong interest in the functionality of Citizens’ Forums. The presence of the chancellor could be interpreted as a public relations exercise, but it may also show willingness to support new forms of political participation.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Even though overall the Citizens’ Forum Europe has been a successful process, the evaluation identified a number of learning points about its design and operation. There are some areas for potential improvement for this format that still has to be established by proving that this process is scalable. The Citizens’ Forum claims to represent the different views and ideas of the German population. However, a closer look at the participants reveals a bias based on the educational background of the participants. Citizens with an academic background were overrepresented. Since citizens were free to decline participation, it is likely that many of the members who accepted were more educated and civic-minded than the population at large. Participation at the Citizens’ Forum might also have been more appealing to people with technological proficiency. Although the deliberative quality and the inclusiveness of the process were on the whole rather high (interestingly, more so during the online phase), more rigorous adherence to the format and application of inclusion rules by the moderators (particularly during the face-to-face events) could have levelled the playing field for all participants. Also, the role of the moderators and the role of the experts could have been made more distinct, and the experts could have been required to take a more neutral stance.  The overall aim of the Citizens’ Forum Europe was not clearly communicated: was it to mobilise and educate the citizens about Europe and the European Union, to develop their democratic skills, to foster a larger public debate on Europe’s future or to influence national and European politicians? At the beginning of the process the organizers stated that the aim was to launch a dialogue between the ordinary citizens and the decision-makers. This did not happen. Although some (national and European) politicians were involved in the process, there was no systematic link between the participatory process and the political sphere. This is problematic for the participants who – encouraged by the presence of Chancellor Angela Merkel – might have expected that the Citizens’ Forum Europe and, in particular, the citizens’ programme would have a measurable impact on political representatives in Berlin and Brussels. The Citizens’ Forum Europe clearly mobilised participants and enhanced their knowledge about the European Union, but the activating spirit, which inspired the minipublic did not transfer to the larger public sphere. A significant public debate about the Citizens’ Forum and its programme did not take place. The next edition of the Citizens’ Forum will be in 2011, the topic still being open. The aim is to involve 10,000 citizens from all over Germany. To this end there will be 25 regional online platforms and a central networking platform.

Time Magazine featured biobanks as one of 10 Ideas Changing the World Right Now. In particular, biobank-based research is an important means for further understanding the multifactorial nature of genetic and environmental factors in causing common diseases. Researchers hope that the genomic knowledge gleaned from such biobanks will enable a better understanding of the role of genetics in disease as well as lead to a more personalized approach to medicine with safer and more effective drug use by permitting individualized therapy (i.e. pharmacogenomics). Biobanks can be disease based (smaller collections of samples obtained from individuals with a specific disease) or population based (larger scale collections obtained from individuals with and without a variety of diseases).  While biobanks offer great promise to health care research, they have sparked significant controversy due to the ethical, legal, and social implications surrounding utilization of samples and data. These issues include: informed consent, ownership, confidentiality, secondary use of samples and data over time, return of results and data sharing, trust, access to samples, and potential commercialization. Such issues present significant challenges for research ethics boards, many of whom are unsure how to deal with such issues resulting in a lack of consistency in committees’ decisions regarding biobanking.  Given these concerns with biobanking and the fact that there is no general agreement as to how best to resolve them, there is an evident need for public engagement on the issue. The purpose of the deliberative forums held in BC, therefore, was to create a mechanism by which meaningful public input could be obtained to inform policy on biobanking. Another purpose, particularly for the BC Biobank Deliberation held in 2007, was to present a proof of principle that it is possible to achieve meaningful and informed policy input on a topic involving complex biotechnology from a randomly selected sample of members of the public.  Background History and Context  In April and May of 2007, a research group at the University of British Columbia implemented the BC Biobank Deliberation. The project was motivated by an observation that although there was an active debate on the social and ethical implications of biobanks, this debate was dominated by experts from the fields of law, bioethics, and medical research. At best, the debate was complemented by certain stakeholder groups, such as disability advocates. What was missing from the debate was a voice from the general public. Although there is little or no awareness of biobanking in the general public, citizens are potentially affected by biobanking policy in a number of ways. For example, patients in hospitals may have tissue removed for clinical reasons (diagnosis or removal of diseased tissue), which may then be used for health research; also large biobanks are often expensive provincial or national projects, and investing in them requires decisions regarding the allocation of public resources. However, difficulties in securing input from the general public include i) that there is little or no public awareness of biobanking and ii) deciding who, precisely, should be invited to a  deliberative forum . The BC Biobank Deliberation was the first attempt to address these challenges, and involved a random demographically stratified sample of 25 British Columbians deliberating and making recommendations on the subject.  The design of the BC Biobank Deliberation was subsequently applied in two other contexts with only minor differences. The Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) used the design to conduct a deliberative forum in late 2007 involving citizens of Olmstead County. The results of that forum were used by the Mayo Clinic to inform the ethical protocols and governance of their own biobank that was being planned at the time. In Western Australia (WA) the Office of Population Health Genomics (OPHG), an office within the Department of Health, was tasked with developing a position statement on biobanking. OPHG involved several stakeholder groups in the development of this document, and also used the design of the BC Biobank Deliberation with minor amendments in 2008 to  consult the citizens of Western Australia  to inform their policy.  One of the characteristics of the deliberation structure of the BC Biobank Deliberation (as well as the Mayo and Western Australian instantiations) was that discussion was relatively unstructured. This was a conscious decision in response to criticisms of public engagements conducted in the context of UK Biobank. These criticisms highlighted a failing in public engagements that are too narrowly focused to allow citizens to have any meaningful opportunity to question underlying principles of such projects as large scale biobanks. Deliberation in the BC Biobank Deliberation was designed to allow for in-depth consideration of issues of concern that emerged from participants' deliberation itself. As a consequence, however, the results of these deliberations are relatively high level, and translation into detailed policy is a non-trivial task.  To address these and other challenges, the UBC research team conducted a second deliberative forum, the BC Biolibrary Deliberation, in April 2009. This project was conducted in collaboration with the BC Biolibrary, a publicly funded organisation that acts as an umbrella across several biobanks to facilitate appropriate access to biospecimens for researchers. Whereas the 2007 Biobank Deliberation aimed to document underlying public values to guide biobanking policy, the 2009 Biolibrary Deliberation aimed to provide more detailed public advice, targeted towards the ethical protocols and governance structures to be adopted by the BC Biolibrary.  Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  The 2007 BC Biobank Deliberation was funded primarily by a Genome Canada grant (Principal Investigators: Michael Burgess, Peter Danielson). The 2009 BC Biolibrary Deliberation was funded primarily by a Genome BC grant (Principal Investigators: Kieran O’Doherty, Peter Watson). Both events had additional support from several other public funding sources (CIHR, BC Biolibrary, BC Cancer Agency Tumor Tissue Repository, The James Hogg iCAPTURE Centre, St. Paul’s Hospital, Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat, Canadian Tumor Repository Network, PROOF Centre of Excellence).  Neither BC forum had an official mandate to influence policy, though a commitment was made by the BC Biolibrary to take into account the results of the 2007 event in their governance. This commitment was formalised when the BC Biolibrary became a collaborator in the implementation of the 2009 event geared more specifically towards informing the ethical protocols and operating procedures of the Biolibrary. The Mayo and WA instantiations of the deliberative forum represent interesting contrasts in mandate. Whereas the BC deliberations were implemented by an independent academic group, the Mayo deliberation was implemented by an institution to inform its own policies, and the WA deliberation was implemented by a government office to inform state policy.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  The aim of recruitment in both the 2007 and 2009 deliberative events was to engage a group of citizens that reflected the diversity of the province of British Columbia. To achieve this, recruitment aimed to engage a random demographically stratified sample of 25 individuals from across the province of British Columbia. In both events participants were recruited to fill stratification for ethnicity, religion, occupational group, and sex on the basis of the 2001 Canadian Census for BC. In addition, at least 2 participants were recruited from each of BC’s 5 health regions. Recruiting from the 5 health regions was deemed to enhance the diversity of experience with health care, and an effort was made to extend the diversity of the sample to include participants that might have been excluded had recruitment relied only on random sampling (i.e., First Nations, disability community, specific religious perspectives).  One notable difference between the two events was that the 2007 Biobank Deliberation used random-digit dialling, whereas the 2009 Biolibrary Deliberation involved mailing invitations to random households, with a second stage of random selection to fill demographic stratifications from respondents to the mail-out. In the 2007 event 21 participants completed the entire event, in the 2009 event it was 23.  Methods and Tools UsedDeliberation  during both the 2007 and 2009 events were conducted in small (7-9 individuals) and large groups. The first event structured group dialogue around the ' Future Workshop ' methodology which allows participants to freely consider future scenarios. Conversely, the second event used ' Thematic Dialogue Tables ' to structure small group deliberation which restricts participants' discussion to one of several topics or themes (in this case, five topics based on ‘areas of ethical ambiguity’ were pre-selected for discussion). Deliberations during both events were facilitated. As well, both events included an informational session where participants  heard from and questioned experts and stakeholders .  What Went On: Process, Interaction, and Participation  Both deliberations were conducted using several core design elements. These included inviting participants to the forum for four days of deliberation over two non-contiguous weekends. The first day was dedicated primarily to informing participants about the topic and introducing them to the idea and practice of deliberation. Information on the topic was provided through an information booklet written specifically for the event, additional key readings from the academic literature, presentations from speakers who were either experts or represented key stakeholder groups, and teaching aids such as a physical model representing biobanking processes. In all this, an effort was made to present information from different perspectives on the subject. For instance, expert and stakeholder speakers included a scientist involved in several biobanks, an indigenous person who was the chair of an ethics board of a tribe that had experience with unethical conduct on the part of scientists, a disabilities advocate, a privacy lawyer, and an ethicist. Deliberation in both events was conducted in small (7-9 individuals) and large groups. Beyond this, the two events differed in structure and outcomes.  In the 2007 Biobank Deliberation, participants’ first deliberative task was to discuss their hopes and concerns about biobanking. Their second and more substantive task was to develop a conceptual design for a hypothetical biobank in BC. In the 2009 Biolibrary Deliberation, participants’ discussed five specific topics that were decided by the hosts of the deliberation and presented in the form of a workbook. These topics were: Collection of Biospecimens, Initial contact/ Introducing the Biobank, Linking Samples to Personal Information, Consent, Governance of Biospecimens and Associated Data. The five topics were chosen based on ‘areas of ethical ambiguity’ that were identified in the context of attempting to establish ethically sustainable protocols, standard operating procedures, and governance structures for the specific case of the BC Biolibrary. A further difference between the two deliberative forums was thus that the first one was implicitly more focused on population based biobanks, whereas the second was focused specifically on disease based biobanks, usually associated with tissue samples collected by pathology departments of hospitals.  One of the key features of both forums is that while deliberation aimed at consensus, facilitators were instructed not to gloss over any disagreements. Rather, if disagreements in basic values persisted in spite of deliberation, these disagreements were to be clearly articulated and documented.  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  In line with the different structures of the two deliberations, the results took very different forms. The outcomes of the 2007 BC Biobank Deliberation took the form of recommendations from the group across a large range of issues including the purpose and anticipated outcomes of biobanks; governance; funding; standardisation of procedures to facilitate research output; privacy, security, and access to research samples; participation and implications for donors; consent; issues of ownership and benefit sharing; public engagement. Across these issues, particular recommendations achieved different levels of agreement and disagreement. Notably, however, three recommendations achieved consensus across the entire group of deliberants:Support for the existence of biobanks in general, and developing a biobank in BC, specifically.  Recommendation that biobanks should have a governing body that is independent of both funders and researchers.  Recommendation that standardization was needed to enhance efficient research use and privacy.The 2009 Biolibrary Deliberation achieved more specific recommendations on the particular topics presented for deliberation (see above). In both deliberations, the final outcomes (whether reflective of consensus or some degree of disagreement) were fed back to deliberants for ratification.  The BC deliberations on biobanking have had several effects and influence, some of which were not anticipated at the outset. The most immediate effect was an influence on the practices of the BC Biolibrary who had made an a priori commitment to public engagement in establishing their organisation. In addition, members of the research team conducting the deliberations sit on various ethics or advisory boards and incorporate findings from the deliberations through their role in the regulation of biobanking practice. An interesting influence to emerge from the deliberations is uptake of the methods of public engagement, as opposed to the actual substance of the views of the deliberants. This makes sense, since the BC deliberations explicitly sought to give voice to the values of the citizens and residents of British Columbia. To achieve similar political legitimacy in other jurisdictions (i.e., Olmstead County, Minnesota, and  Western Australia ) thus required the implementation of similar forums using local participants. Finally, an unexpected outcome of the deliberations was that participants of the forums have since been recruited to act as community advisors on biobank boards or advisories. Because participants of these forums have been exposed to a diversity of views and perspectives on biobanking and its potential effects on the community, they have the unique quality of being able to represent a range of viewpoints on an issue about which there is relatively little public awareness.  Analysis and Lesson Learned  By virtue of being academic projects, data emerging from the deliberations have been analysed along several dimensions. These include exploration of the deliberations for particular substantive issues (e.g., informed consent to participate in biobanks; public views on privacy implications) as well as analyses of process related issues (e.g., reliance of deliberants on media coverage of biobanks; reliance of deliberants on information presented by expert and stakeholder speakers). Other analyses have focussed on interpreting data emerging from the deliberations in the context of ongoing debates in the academic literature on such issues as how individuals draw on different aspects of their identity to warrant claims in deliberation, and the discursive logics that can be seen to operate in deliberation.  A criticism that can be levelled at the 2007 Biobank Deliberation is that there was a design flaw in the way the final session of the deliberation was handled. The deliberative event was structured in such a way that the participants were divided into three small groups, each of which came up with its own recommendations on issues they felt were most important, and that they subsequently presented to the large group. The purpose of the final session of the deliberative event was to integrate the recommendations of the three separate groups into one coherent set of results. This attempt was only partially successful as only a small proportion of the issues that were discussed over the course of the event in the small groups was able to be covered in this final large group discussion. This failure was a result of more than simply insufficient time to address all issues discussed in the small groups. Many participants expressed frustration at having to revisit arguments they had covered in detail in their small groups. In many instances, deliberation in the final large group discussion faltered over misunderstandings, and confusion and disagreement regarding different meanings attached to terminology (e.g., standardisation).  A further purpose of the 2009 Biolibrary Deliberation was thus to refine the deliberative design to overcome this problem. This was successfully achieved by limiting discussions in the small groups to an exchange of views only, without facilitators guiding deliberations towards group consensus. The small group discussions thus served to help people to explore and articulate their own views on a particular aspect of biobanking, and to expose them to the views of others in the group. The goal of reaching agreement on particular recommendations on biobanking policy was reserved exclusively for discussion in the large group. This strategy proved to be effective in that the consideration of the full complement of deliberants was brought to bear on all issues, and none of the participants expressed frustration at having to revisit particular arguments or discussions.

As state leaders considered competing reform proposals, thousands of Californians came together in an unprecedented statewide conversation to ensure that the public had a voice in shaping the state’s health care policy. Independent evaluations show that participants stayed involved in the issue, policymakers valued the process and the resulting health care reform legislation reflected 3/4 of the public’s priorities identified during CaliforniaSpeaks.  Background History and Context  While California spends almost $2 billion each year on health care, the state struggles to provide adequate care to all. At any given time, nearly five million state residents live without health insurance. The majority of those with health insurance believe their coverage does not meet their needs, with 75 percent saying they would not be able to handle the costs of a major illness or injury.  To address this growing crisis, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared 2007 the “year of health care"" and several state leaders dedicated themselves to addressing this crisis. The lawmakers introduced a range of proposals that represented different approaches to reforming the state’s health care system. The Governor's health care insurance reform plan consisted of six key health care reform topics: employer mandate; expansion of public subsidies and programs, changes to insurers; individual mandate; government-based system; and cost controls. These six reforms break down into requirements that employers provide health insurance or pay into a state insurance pool, that health care providers and insurers pay a new fee, and that all individuals be required by law to carry health insurance; the state would use these new fees to generate free or low-cost health insurance to those who with low incomes, would allow higher income people to buy “catastrophe"" insurance and would require health insurance companies to sell health insurance to any applicant.  Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  To ensure that the Californian public had a real voice in the reform process, six local health care foundations invited the national nonprofit organization  AmericaSpeaks ,a group that advocates public participation as a community method in various communities, to facilitate a statewide town meeting for the public to weigh in on the reforms being considered by state leaders.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  CaliforniaSpeaks brought together nearly 3,500 Californians on August 11, 2007 in eight locations, for an all-day, non-partisan conversation on health care reform. Efforts were made to ensure that these discussions included balanced demographic representation as well as the participation of state lawmakers.Demographically Representative ParticipantsTo ensure that the diversity of the state was represented and the outcomes of the discussion were fair and credible, CaliforniaSpeaks invited a random sample of thousands of Californians to participate in the discussion. Over 120,000 Californians across the state were identified and contacted by phone and mail. The random invitations were selected by non-partisan experts in statistical sampling from listed phone numbers.  The forum was intended to reach ordinary Californians and not organized special interest groups. An opinion research firm recruited 71% of the attendees, including guests who had been randomly selected. The aim was to reach 4,000 attendees; 3,500 attended.  Based on past experiences with random recruitment outreach, sampling experts have found that it tends to be significantly more difficult to ensure that certain demographic groups are well represented. In order to help make sure that these voices were adequately reflected in the discussion, CaliforniaSpeaks oversampled outreach to these demographics through its random recruitment and extended additional invitations through a grassroots outreach strategy to organizations that had not taken a position on the topic.  Participants were generally reflective of the state’s demography in the areas of income and health status. The forum brought in more female (67%), middle-aged (58%) and Caucasian (60%) than the state's population reflects. They were also more likely to identify themselves as Democrats.Participants stating they did not have health insurance were 13% of the total, about in line with the statewide level (i.e., 4.5 million out of 37 million Californians in the 2005 California Health Interview Survey). The Latino community turnout was less than desired despite targeted outreach to Latino groups.State Lawmaker ParticipationState lawmakers joined participants at the meeting, including Governor Schwarzenegger, Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata, Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez, and Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines. Each confirmed that health care reform was an urgent priority for California and restated a commitment to legislative action.  Methods and Tools Used  The CaliforniaSpeaks event used the  AmericaSpeaks '  21st Century Town Meeting  format which includes face-to-face  deliberation  and the use of electronic  Audience Response Systems . This case was unique in its use of satellite video technology to simultaneously connect participants in all 8 town meetings held across the state. All  roundtable discussions  were supported by professional facilitators.  What Went On: Process, Interaction, and Participation  Participants from every walk of life joined simultaneous town meetings in Humboldt County, Sacramento, Oakland, Fresno, San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego, all linked together by satellite technology. Using AmericaSpeaks’ 21st Century Town Meeting® method, diverse groups participated in roundtable discussions that were supported by professional facilitators. Groupware computers and keypad technology enabled ideas to be captured live and prioritized by all participants at the eight meeting sites.  CaliforniaSpeaks worked with state and national experts, in cooperation with state leaders, to develop non-partisan and accessible discussion materials to put real choices before the public. To help the discussion move along easily and generate interaction between the participants, discussion guides with background on the policy areas were provided. These guides were made available in Chinese, Spanish and other languages. The participants were divided into groups of 10-12 people in which each proposal was discussed and its merits or drawbacks debated.Topics of Dialogue and DeliberationThe CaliforniaSpeaks discussion topics were chosen with an eye towards ensuring that the public could weigh in on actual decisions being made in the upcoming legislative session from August 20 to September 20, 2007. Six proposed changes to the existing health care system were presented and discussed throughout the day. Participants identified the conditions, if any, under which they would support each of these changes:Employer requirement to contribute to employee health care  Expansion of government programs for vulnerable populations  Guaranteed issue requirement for insurers  Cap on insurer administrative costs and profits  Individual mandate to have insurance  Government-based health care systemIn the original program for the event, the single payer reform proposal was not focused on because the Governor and legislative leadership had hinted that they were not going to take up the bill; however, this was a concern for the many participants who believed that the debate had to cover the issue, so the agenda was expanded to include it. Of the six policy reforms put forward, at least 50% of the participants were willing to support each as long as there were some changes that would be met.Key Conditions for Reform OptionsParticipants were asked to identify the conditions that would need to be in place in order to support major policy reforms being considered by state leaders. Examples of measures receiving the greatest support are:63 percent would support expanding government-sponsored health coverage for low- and middle-income Californians if it included provisions for wellness and prevention  59 percent would support “guaranteed issue” requiring insurers to provide coverage to people regardless of medical condition if there is sufficient accountability and oversight to make sure that all are actually covered  55 percent would support an “individual mandate” requiring all Californians to have health insurance if there is an adequate standard for quality care  96 percent of participants agreed that it was important to control costs. This was critically important to two-thirds of participantsMandate for ChangeParticipants indicated a desire and readiness for change in California’s health care system, along with a clear willingness to help pay for it if needed:82% said the system requires major change  86% said it’s essential or important for state health care reform to pass that year (2007)  84% said they are at least somewhat willing to share responsibility for paying for reformEarly in the day, participants were asked: “What are the one or two values that you believe should guide us and our leaders as we reform our health care system?” Eight overarching values were generated from the table discussions and theme team analysis, with four emerging as most important to participants across all locations:Health care should be affordable to all – “Quality of care shouldn’t depend on the money they have available”  everyone should have access – “All life is precious and important; consider people regardless of circumstances” (e.g. vulnerable populations)  Keep greed out of the healthcare system – Put “people before profit”  Make wellness and prevention a priorityInfluence, Outcomes, and Effects  CaliforniaSpeaks participants emphatically called for reform. Across all eight meeting locations, 82 percent of participants said that the state’s health care system required major change, and 86 percent said it was important for reform to pass by year’s end.  Addressing a key concern for decision makers, 84 percent of all participants said they were at least “somewhat willing” to share financial responsibility for reform, with a full two thirds saying they were “willing” or “very willing.”Participants Remain ActiveAfter the event, participants remained committed in their call for health care reform, writing letters to the editor and sending e-mails to their representatives. Throughout the month following the meeting, CaliforniaSpeaks participants and organizers met with key legislators and staff in their district offices to present town meeting results.LegislationIn mid-September, Governor Schwarzenegger called a special legislative session specifically to address health care reform. The result was a compromise health care reform bill, AB 1X1, which was passed in December 2007 by the California State Assembly with bi-partisan support from the Governor and Assembly Speaker. The announcement of a $14 billion budget deficit for the state stalled the legislation in the Senate. The bill ultimately failed to pass out of the Senate Health Committee after a legislative analysis questioned the bill’s financial risk.Public Impacts of CaliforniaSpeaksThree independent evaluations assessed the impact of the CaliforniaSpeaks statewide conversation, on participants, the policy making process and policy makers themselves. Evaluations were performed by (1) Archon Fung, Harvard University &amp; Taeku Lee, University of California, Berkeley, (2) Harder + Company Community Research, and, (3) Peter Harbage, Harbage Consulting.[3] Evaluations were reported in Public Impacts: Evaluating the outcomes of the CaliforniaSpeaks statewide conversation on health care reform.  Participants –  Surveys  of CaliforniaSpeaks participants found significant impacts compared to a control group. Participants were more positive about their attitudes about state government as a result of the event and had a greater belief in their own ability to be heard and make a difference. CaliforniaSpeaks participants were significantly more likely to take political action on health care – such as volunteering with a group, attending public meetings and contacting the media – compared to those who did not attend.  Policymakers – Policymakers hailed CaliforniaSpeaks as a successful event that brought in fresh public perspectives and generated a sense of urgency for bi-partisan change. The interviewed policy leaders pointed to key elements that helped build momentum, like the size of the convening, diversity of the participants, and how the technology allowed for multiple locations to have “direct” public participation with immediate results. Policymakers welcomed this kind of event to be conducted again in California, and recommend it for early stages of the policymaking process.  Policy Outcomes - The CaliforniaSpeaks process generated public priorities on values to guide health care reform as well as conditions of support for specific policy priorities. A comparison of these priorities with the evolution of the proposed health reform bills show that reform moved closer to CaliforniaSpeaks priorities on 3⁄4 of issues in debate. In fact, on all of the values and most of the policy options under active discussion by the full legislature, the legislation evolved to more clearly reflect the public’s priorities.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Taeku Lee, an associate professor at Berkeley, observed the event and its impact. Lee concluded that[1]:As a group, participants’ substantive discussions about health care priorities and reform proposals reflected a high degree of sophistication and closely matched the two reform proposals that were ultimately submitted to the state legislature.  Participants’ opinions on health care reform itself, however, changed very little as a consequence of the deliberative event, or five months after the event.  Participants’ views about politics itself changed more significantly – specifically, their trust in government and their political efficacy increased appreciably.  Participants’ level of political engagement – at least on the issue of health care reform – rose markedly as a consequence of the deliberative event.CriticismsCritisms of the event include concern that the issue of single payer was not adequately explored during the town meeting. Organizers' responded by reiterating the purpose of the event, which was to examine existing California health care reform proposals; no such proposals were on the table at the time of CaliforniaSpeaks.  Another concern was the low turn out of Latino voters, who constituted 12% of CaliforniaSpeaks participants, but are 32% of Californians overall. White, middle-class, democratic females were the majority. The debate failed to lure in a diversity of the Californian population. This lack of overall participation could lead to a more biased view on the changes made to the bill. Many Latinos belong to the working class in which health care reform is an essential issue; therefore, it is imperative to have their input for such major changes. Moreover, the lack of input from minority groups can lead to racial conflicts and a mistrust of government. In response, Greg Keiden, Researcher and CaliforniaSpeaks Outreach Staff, published an analysis and series of recommendations to include Latino Americans in public decision making processes, in a National Civic Review article titled Latino Outreach Strategies for Civic Engagement.[2]  See Also21st Century Town MeetingAmericaSpeaksReferences  [1] ↑ Lee, Taeku.

The Washington State Legislature had failed to impose gas tax (or other) dollars to care for an aging/in need of expansion transportation system, and voter confidence was affecting tax measures. The purpose of TPP, therefore was to allow citizens, stakeholders, and the diverse communities of Clark County to explore local and regional transportation priorities (Dream It), transportation funding options (Fund It), and key strategies to address the transportation challenges important to maintaining this region’s high quality of life (Build It). (1)A grassroots-effort to learn what citizens want, what are they willing to pay for and how they willing to pay for it was designed and taken out into the community. A series of 32 smaller community meetings led to five larger community forums, all of which led to a community-wide all-day summit over a short, three-month time period (August through November 2002).TPP was InterACT’s way of hearing the diverse perspectives, perceptions, and opinions in the community on three critical questions:What do citizens want?  What are they willing to pay for?  How do they prefer to pay for it?Along the way citizens were provided education and information on how transportation works – from concept to design to construction. As they “learned,” their perceptions of transportation changed somewhat – which told us that education was certainly a key to understanding and support of transportation issues. In addition we learned that people care deeply what happens in their neighborhoods, and see fixing travel around the County and to and from Oregon as a priority, and if people know their money will be spent on local projects – and there is an accountability factor - they are willing to pay for it.  The result of the project is a report to the community . . . jurisdictions, citizens and legislators . . . which includes a list of recommendations and how we got there. The model we used, which was to some extent a design-as-you-go process, worked beautifully and could work equally well for a multitude of issues.  We still don’t have all the answers but are currently designing Transportation Priorities Project Phase II which will lead us to most of the answers . . . the bottom line being, what will be supported when voters go to the polls.  History  In the last 20 years Washington state’s population has increased by 48%, jobs have increased by 58%, and vehicle miles traveled increased by 88%. All the while, total personal income as grown by 110%, the state capital outlay for road capacity per dollar of personal income dropped by 50%. Clark County had a population of 192,000 in 1980; today there are about 363,000 people living in Clark County with over 200,000 cars. This is a population growth increase of 82% and more cars today than the number of people in Clark County in 1980. ( Excerpted from the Transportation Briefing Document for TPP, prepared by Dean Lookingbill (RTC))  (1)  Organizing Entities and Funding  Initial funding for TPP came from InterACT’s sponsoring organization, Identity Clark County (ICC), a not-for- profit organization concerned with economic and community development in Clark County. ICC was able to provide $25,000 in funding from its transportation committee’s budget. Southwest Washington’s Regional Transportation Council contributed an additional $25,000 of federal funds. Additional support came from jurisdictions throughout Clark County. Thanks to the volunteers and generous in-kind contributions, this ambitious, countywide, citizen-led, fast-paced, stakeholder engagement process was accomplished on a very lean budget. (1)  Participation Recruitment and Selection  The Project Management teams for TPP were ""Citizen-led."" This means that members of the InterACT board helped manage the project. The board invited other individuals to participate, who volunteered their time to enlist support and participation from other citizens in Clark County. ""Citizen-led"" also means that no government body was leading or managing this process.  The TPP Management Team consisted of: Marjorie Casswell, InterACT project manager; Brian Wolfe, InterACT chair; John McKibbin and Ginger Metcalf, Identity Clark County; and Walt and Tammy Roberts, The Performance Center. The TPP Design Team was comprised of the Management Team and a small group of citizens from around Clark County. The TPP Outreach and Action Team added another 30 citizens that were chosen to be representative of the entire county, which was divided into five regions: Central, North, South Central, Southeast, and Southwest. TPP Area Outreach and Action Teams identified groups and organized TPP Meetings and Forums in various communities in each of the five areas. Each of these various teams met on numerous occasions to develop and refine the design of each element of the TPP process. In addition, Dean Lookingbill, Director of the Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council (RTC), with his helpful and capable staff, provided the TPP team with invaluable information and jurisdictions outreach support throughout the process. (1)  Methods and Tools Used Deliberation and Public Interaction  The TPP process began with twenty-three government officials who were consulted and interviewed about the project to seek their opinions and views on local and countywide transportation issues. A set of questions was developed and presented for participants at 32 TPP Area Meetings, which were conducted throughout Clark County. These Meetings were guided and aided by the input from the Jurisdictions Interviews and the TPP Design Team.  These Area Meetings were designed to seek participants’ views with minimum influence from presentations or group discussions. Each Area Meeting was 90 minutes or less and captured the opinions and preferences of participating citizens through the use of an electronic keypad polling system and written comments. Area Meeting participants were not given time to reference a document providing a very general overview of transportation planning and funding information, nor were they given an opportunity to discuss the topics and questions prior to giving their input.  Four TPP Area Meeting sessions were held at Battle Ground High School. The meeting was restricted to an hour in which the students focused on the subject and questions related only to transportation performance and funding options. They did not have time to explore transportation system concerns, priorities for improvement, and priority actions for improving the system. The summary results from the high school sessions are presented separately from the input received at the balance of the TPP Area Meetings. This information provides a glimpse of how “younger” citizen participants’ perceptions differed from the “older” participants’ perceptions. (1)  Next, five TPP Area Forums were conducted. These Area Forums were 2 1⁄2 hours long and were designed to give participants more information about transportation planning processes, funding mechanics and trends, and the results from the area meetings. Participants also had an opportunity to have small and large group discussions before turning to keypad polling and written comments to give their input.  The Area Meetings polling summary results were compared to the Area Forums polling summary results and presented at the TPP Summit, a daylong event. All written input from both TPP activities was shown at the Summit. Around 110 citizens and 30 government officials listened to a series of presenters, engaged in small and large group discussions, and compared their views, opinions and preferences through keypad polling and written comments. (1)  The process was designed to be a “progressive ‘conversation’”(1) so that the information gathered at Area Meetings was comprehensive, summarized, and presented at the Area Forums. The TPP Summit deliberations were framed upon the information brought forward from Area Meetings and Area Forums. As it progressed, The TPP process increased in substance, quality, and size.  Findings  At the end of the entire process, a few key findings surfaced. For one, people care deeply what happens in their neighborhoods, and see fixing travel around the county and to and from Oregon as a priority. Additionally, Information, or education, changes what and how people think about transportation, for the better. Lastly, If people know their money will be spent on local projects, they will be willing to pay for it. (1)  One of the most significant findings was the strong interest expressed to pursue a regional funding authority, approach and strategy. A regional funding mechanism that keeps local tax dollars in the region and leverages potential matching funds gained in priority, support and interest as TPP progresed. Additionally, a possible regional gas tax gained in popularity. (1)  Some TPP Participants’ Comments (1):System support has fallen way behind system demand - incremental measures and system controls will not make a significant difference and bridge the gap. We need to transform the system considering the full scope of resources and demands.  Developing a regional transportation system plan seems to be a good idea. We need a plan that designs projects for a BALANCED (roads, transit, bike/pedestrian, etc.) system and links funding phases to specific project lists. Seek funding for phased lists, deliver the projects, and then proceed with similar process for future phases. Jurisdictions must coordinate to do this successfully.  Clark County planning is not going to get any more billion-dollar projects if it does not improve roads! Clark County is years behind the planning for growth and trafficWhat are the top transportation system concerns?Transportation Funding/Spending  Transportation to/from Oregon  Transportation Planning/Policy/StrategyWhat are the top priorities for improvement for the transportation system?Transportation Funding/Spending  Transportation Planning/Policy/Strategy  Transportation to/from OregonTo measure perceptions of the transportation system’s current performance the following three categories were defined (1):Neighborhood/Local Community Transportation : Local capacity, upkeep, safety, traffic calming, traffic signals, sidewalks and pedestrian crossings, school bus routes and zones, parking, etc.Transportation Throughout Clark County : Keeping the current roads and related infrastructure in good condition. Improving and creating new capacity (mostly roads) within the county to ease congestion, improve access and reduce travel times to destinations within the County. Provide more choices/alternatives/public transit/bike lanes to better get around the county.Transportation to/from Oregon : Easing peak congestion through improved bridges, transit service, special commuter lanes, and widening I-5 bottlenecks. Could include pay-to-use systems, commuter rail and or light rail. Keeping up with maintenance and safety of existing system.  On this website  http://www.rtc.wa.gov/InterACT/ [DEAD LINK] is the project report  http://www.rtc.wa.gov/InterACT/reports/TPP-Findings.pdf  [DEAD LINK] prepared by Walt Robeerts / The Performance Center, which details how the project was conceived, designed and executed, and documents the results. The “Additional Information” provided as attachments to the report capture direct comments/concerns from the jurisdictions prior to launching the project, actual text of polling questions used, keypad technology polling results, a transportation briefing document (educational piece), direct citizen input comments, and jurisdiction reactions to the project.  Strengths &amp; Weaknesses  The greatest strength of the TPP process is the diversity of opinions received from participants. The greatest challenge was the task of getting people to attend meetings. Additionally, the length of the entire process (3 months) was a short period of time to reach out and obtain participants in such a large county.  Feedback from many of the TPP Summit participants, jurisdictions’ representatives, and TPP Management Team members strongly suggest that it is both timely and worthwhile to continue the TPP process or something like it. At this time (February 2003), a plan for continuing the TPP effort has not been fully formulated. The TPP Management Team will seek input on the purpose, value, products, leadership, funding, timing, and format for the next phase of TPP. (1) Recommendations The following are a few recommendations offered from participants (1):First and foremost, TPP needs a home, and needs to continue with the same intense grassroots participation  Lobby for a statewide funding mechanism that includes a regional transportation funding component  Coordinate jurisdictions planning efforts and present a unified/winning case to receive state and federal funding  Approach transportation planning from a complete system perspective  Broaden and increase efforts to inform citizens on all aspects of transportationSecondary Sources  1.

For the engagement mission, King County officials hope to ascertain the main issues that citizens of the King County are most concerned about. All taking place within the King County area, engagement during the forum is most spent upon a specific topic that the leader of the forum is covering that is relevant to the public’s issues and interest of King County. The forums allow participants to deliberate among themselves about the topic, discussing and learning from each other’s point of views and experiences that dealt with the topic. One of the main reasons why this community forum was created was for citizens of King County to relay their issues to the public officials in a quick and simple way.Background History and ContextThe Countywide Community Forums was formed September 9, 2007 as a result of Initiative 24. According to Dick Spady from Easy Citizens’ Involvement, the initiative allows effective feedback from citizens to county council members. The initiative will also only further encourage the citizen’s “right to be heard, a right retained by the people under the ninth amendments.” On the Initiative 24 webpage, Dick further states that the Countywide Community Forums will also “enable the public to communicate symbolically among themselves and with their leaders on issues and questions of concern in an ongoing iterative process. People participating will do so out of a sense of ennoblement in an effort to help the common good.”The CCF is also a result of the unanimous adoption of Ordinance 15896. This particular ordinance relates to promoting civic engagement. The preamble accentuates the basic freedoms of citizens such as freedom of speech, freedom of petition and freedom of assembly. The reasoning behind the idea of Countywide Community Forums is that “there is a need to create a citizen councilor network of small discussion groups, open to all citizens, self-funded and using symbolic and sustainable dialogue to communicate among political and other community leaders and the people at large.”Organizing, Supporting, and Funding EntitiesDicks Drive-In Restaurants, the King County Government, and the Forum Foundation are all sponsors of the Countywide Community Forums. Matt Rosenberg, Dick Spady’s successor, leads the entire organization. John Spady and Carrie Shaw are the deputy coordinators. They oversee program operations, data collection, and control program funds. Chantal Stevens is the program oversight manager in the auditor’s office. Stevens serves as the public’s primary county government contact for the program.The Countywide Community Forum is funded by the community support, mainly by Dick Spady, creator of the iconic Seattle institution Dick's Drive-In Restaurants. However, with its great appeal to the community, the community forum has created a web page foronline donationto the forum. With the support of family, Spady pledged that his private business would underwrite the cost for the first two years of the Countywide Community Forums. This states that the underwritten cost would include the cost of the county employee in the Auditor’s Office, and all the costs associated with production, distribution, and website creation: a stated commitment of $350,000. During the end of its third year, Spady’s Dick’s Drive-In has recommitted itself through the end of 2010. John Spady is currently one of three coordinators appointed by the King County Auditor. His official title for the King County Auditor is “Deputy Citizen Councilor Coordinator.”The Auditor’s Office has received many donations about 69 donations, ranging from $1 to $100 for a total of $1,200. This was a critical point of the King County, because it believed that no tax dollars were to be put and maintain the Countywide Community Forum. Although the county does not spend its money on the Countywide Community Forum at all, King County is directly involved in the program, and provides oversight through its auditor’s office to assure impartiality and integrity. Another method that the Countywide community forum is getting its funding is by and envelope that is attached to the opinion surveys, encouraging the participants to donate to the cause that they had just partaken in.Participant Recruitment and SelectionThe registration process of attending the deliberations first include gaining online membership at the main website. After becoming a member, the website easily allows residents to search for conveniently located meetings conducted by voluntary hosts throughout the county. The website also gives members an option to host a meeting themselves and offers a hosts training session. Each group consists between 4-12 participants including the host.The forums are placed anywhere within the King County area, generally within a public space where forums are designed to be convenient gather spots. There can be forums in living rooms or workplaces since any individual can lead the forums.Methods and Tools UsedEach meeting consists of the same topic, an introductory video, “Day in the Sun” talks (a time for each participant to speak freely for two minutes pertaining to personal experiences and opinions regarding the topic without interruptions), an open discussion, and a finalsurveyreferred to as an ""Opinionairre."" The purpose of the final opinionnaire is to provide feedback to county officials. There are quarterly meetings and about four topics open for discussion a year.What Went On: Process, Interaction, and ParticipationDuring the forum, each of the participants are being assessed about the issue by having background materials and a video that presents diverse opinions from various distinguished panelist about the topic. Usually the distinguished panelists are from different leaders of King County such as counsel chairs of Seattle, superintendents of transportation, etc. depending on what the topic is being covered in the forum. After the videos are done being viewed, the participants will deliberate among themselves about the topic, discussing and learning from each other’s point of views and experiences that dealt with the topic. At this point, each of the participants should be able to expand their own points of views and understand different values and views from others.The last mission that the Countywide Community Forum reflects on is informing the public officials. One of the main reasons why this community forum was created was for citizens of King County to relay their issues to the public officials very fast and simple. At the end of the forum, the participants would then fill out an opinionsurveyon the selected topic. The survey would have a vast array of questions in great detail regarding the King County system to see whether it has been successful in specific positions or not. The surveys would then be on a report and sent to the King County and would be filed and published on the King County website and presents to the King County Council, public officials, the general public and media press about the findings from the report. This report gives a final detail to the county that helps guide future decisions of King County.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  The following are previous topics:Transportation: Public Priorities, Choices, and Funding – June, 2008  Citizen Priorities for County Government: Budget and Strategic Priorities – Feb, 2009  Values and Performance of King County Government – May, 2009  Public Safety: Law and Justice – Sept, 2009Analysis and Lessons Learned  Professor John Gastil is a political scientist and professor at the University of Washington Seattle Campus. In his book, Political Communication and Deliberation, Gastil defines the term deliberation into three parts. He states that ""deliberation begins when we create a solid information base to make sure we understand the nature of the problem at hand. Second, we identify and prioritize the key values at stake in an issue. Third, we identify a broad range of solutions that might address the problem."" Based on this concept of political deliberation, the CCF is set up to follow a deliberative manner. By starting off with the informational video, the participants start off with the information base and attempt to understand the problem. After the ""Day in the Sun"" round, participants are given the opportunity to prioritize key issues within the given topic. And last, in the general discussion, participants are given the opportunity to discuss together possible solutions to problems.  For the Spring 2010 quarter for Professor John Gastil’s class, Political Deliberation, the undergraduate class of about 70 participated in the Countywide Community Forums and was asked to critique the process to three representatives from the CCF.  One of the main concerns from the class was the introductory video. Many of the student participants complained of the validity of facts within the video. One student claimed that the introductory video felt more like a campaign stunt from the county council officials because there was a lack of factual and statistical information offered. Another concern was the choice of topic. Many student participants complained of the choice of topic stating that it was too board and vague to discuss in forty-five minutes. Another main concern was the length of the opinionnaires. Many students felt that the opinionnaires were too long and tedious.Comparison With Other Community Engagement MethodsKing County of Washington is not the only county nor organization that has created a community group for the people. Such organizations like the  Citizen Initiative Review of Oregon  and the  Daly City Community Forums  of California has created their own community forums for the public.  The Citizen Initiative Review (CIR) process is based on the  Citizens Jury  model. Ned Crosby, founder of the  Jefferson Center  and  Healthy Democracy  Oregon, has been organizing Citizen Juries in the United States for the past 30 years. Ned Crosby and Pat Benn have been designing the Citizen Initiative Review process since 1999 to support initiative reform efforts. The Citizen Initiative Review is represented by the group of Oregon votes that are randomly selected to meet for a five day process to discuss the issues and evaluate its effectiveness or non-impactness to the public. Like King County’s Countywide Community Forum, the participants of this organization would hear  testimony from policy experts , advocates for and against the measures, and affected stakeholders. After hearing from the distinguished panelist, they will engage in facilitated conversation from a moderator to determine their findings and discuss their opinions on the given facts. At the end of the  deliberation , the people would create a “Citizens’ Statement” to articulate their findings that will be published along with text of the initiative and statements for and against the initiative in the voter’s pamphlet. There are similarities of the CIR to the CCF, however to the Oregon’s organization, their participants are generally selected. The participants are random, about 20 people chosen, but at the final part in creating the panel, they are picked according to age, gender, ethnicity, education, residence and political affiliation, in order to have a diverse group of Oregon citizens. In the hope of Healthy Democracy Oregon’s director, “It can also become a symbol or exemplar of democratic innovation to others working to improve democracy.” So far there has been positive reception to the creation of CIR.  Another Community forum that was created is the Daly City Community Forums. Created in 2009, this community forum was established to help with the budgeting allocations for the different funding level for city programs and services. However, unlike King County CCF, Daly City’s specifically talks about budgeting and does not have various topics to discuss in addition that the community forum ended at the end of 2009. Like the King County forum, there were facilitators that were trained for the public forums. Participants discussed the qualities of a good community, and what city services they were and were not willing to see reduced or cut. There were only four public forums that were held over five weeks In order to have the citizens in Daly City, California to receive the information, their public interaction method was to distribute newsletter to all the homes, including surveys and invitation to special events. To make the surveys cover various homes, it was made available in four other languages (including English) so that residents who were not fluent in English would participate as well as sending out fliers to all the different local communities and libraries in various languages.

In Philadelphia they had to close a deficit of $108 million in the next six months; the shortfall over five years was projected to be more than $1 billion. At this time the city was going to make cuts to city-owned resources including, three ice rinks being closed in the winter unless private funding could be found, and 68 pools being shutdown in the summer, Eleven libraries would close, and three others would lose their Sunday hours. Snowplowing and street resurfacing would be reduced; residential street cleaning will be eliminated. The job cuts included 220 layoffs and the elimination of 600 open positions. The city has about 23,000 employees, which meant the cuts were going to affect people all over the city. In response,  Penn Project for Civic Engagement  based at the University of Pennsylvania created the Tight Times, Tough Choices civil forum.  The purpose of the forum was to allow citizens to have a say in how the budget for 2010 was going to be spent. The idea was to have four different open forums scattered around the city where any taxpayer was welcome. The testimonies were then given to the Mayor who then presented his findings to the city council. The Penn Project for Civic Engagement also had the city officials explain how they used the findings from the forum in their decision-making. The decision on how to use the cities budget affects all of the tax payers, and the purpose of these forums was to give them an outlet to let their voice be heard.  Background History and Context  The group that set up the forums, the Penn Project for Civic Engagement, was created in 2006. Its director and co-founder is Dr. Harris Sokoloff, who is one of the nation's leading experts in civic dialogue. The co-founder is Chris Satullo, formerly editorial page editor of The Inquirer and now executive director of news and civic dialogue at WHYY. Although The Penn Project for Civic Engagement was formally set up in 2006, both Sokoloff and Satullo have been leading civic dialogue projects around the region since 1996, including the Citizen Voices program and the Penn's Landing Forums. PPCE has led citizen dialogues for projects such as the Central Delaware Visioning Project (Penn Praxis), Great Expectations, the Kimmel Center re-envisioning, the City That Works forums, and the Big Canvas arts and culture project.  Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  The  Penn Project for Civic Engagement  was asked by city officials to lead the 2009-2010 budget forum because of their record of leading forums that produce meaningful citizen input.  Participant Recruitment and Selection  These events are designed to give Philadelphians a chance to learn up-to-date information about the city's fiscal condition, using it to help work through the urgent budget decisions facing the city. The idea is for citizens to weigh the real-world choices facing the city, and to give city officials guidance on how citizens would prefer to see them handled. The forum had four different meeting times and locations around the city. The locations were in public spaces that could hold many people as well as free parking and close to public transportation. Space was limited; it was first come first serve. There was no pre-reservations; the participants showed up the day of the forums and registered. Roughly 1,710 people were involved in the forum. The breakdown of demographics was: a majority was female (65 percent); the racial mix was 57 percent Anglo white, 32 percent African-American, and 11 percent other minority. The median age was between 36 and 45, and the median income between $40,000 and $60,000.  Methods and Tools Used  Generally speaking, this initiative is an example of  participatory budgeting , a method of democratic innovation broadly described as ""a decision-making process through which citizens deliberate and negotiate over the distribution of public resources."" There are many benefits associated with participatory budgeting including increased  civic  and  democratic  education; increased government transparency; and an increased opportunity for participation by historically marginalized populations.[ 1 ]  Specific to this case was the use of  public hearings  used to allow citizens to learn about the budgeting process and to question public officials. As well,  small group deliberations  with facilitators allowed participants to brainstorm and discuss priorities and provide suggestions.  What Went On: Process, Interaction, and ParticipationThe Learning PhaseThe event started with the participants getting a briefing on the city's budget that they are working with. Then they were given information about the work that went into developing the budget choices that they would be discussing later that night. The briefing came in the form of a  panel discussion , with top city officials such as Managing Director Camille Barnett, Finance Director Rob Dubow, and Budget Director Steve Agostini answering questions posed by the Philadelphia WHYY journalists Tom Ferrick and Chris Satullo.The Public Hearings PhaseThe next step was having the forum members divided into working groups of roughly 20. There, working with trained moderators, they reviewed the budget choices facing the city, decide how they'd prefer to handle the tradeoffs involved, and explain why they made those choices. The groups were then given a worksheet and asked to review a list of more than 26 ways to close the city's nearly $200 million budget gap. Some cut costs and others raised revenues, by increasing existing fees, proposing new fees, or increasing taxes.TheDeliberationPhaseAfter the worksheets, in small groups, they deliberated on the choices, trying to reach 100 points (with each point roughly equal to $2 million). With the help of moderators from the Penn Project for Civic Engagement, they sorted the actions into four categories (or buckets):The Low-Hanging Fruit: Actions that the group could agree on quickly. A 75 percent vote was needed to put something in this bucket.  The No Way, No Hows: Actions the group wanted off the table, post-haste and permanently. Again, a 75 percent vote was needed to stick something in that bucket. (Most groups found it much easier to fill this bucket than the others.)  The Shared Pain: The actions people really didn't want to approve, but realized they would have to consider if they wanted to make it to 100 points. This is where the evenings' liveliest, most interesting discussions took place. An item could get put onto the Shared Pain list by a simple majority vote.  The Gut Wrenchers: These were the really painful ideas that groups had rejected earlier, or avoided discussing all night, that ended up getting considered in the last-minute quest to get a decent number of points on the board.  A fifth bucket, No Decisions, developed by default. These were actions the groups either never got around to reviewing, or discussed with no clear conclusion. For many groups, that ended up being the biggest bucket of all. Out of the 53 different breakout groups across the four forums while most groups were in the 35-60 point range, a few groups got nearly to 100 points, an amazing display of working through painful tradeoffs.Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Some of the popular trends included:Citizens tended to oppose strongly anything they perceived would harm those services likely to be needed by the people who are must vulnerable in these perilous economic times. For example, human services, public health and housing services got tabbed as a No Way, No How item even more often than did Police or the Free Library.  After taking cuts to things such as shelter beds and health centers off the table early, many groups decided later in the evening, however grudgingly, that they had to support significant tax hikes to demonstrate how serious they really were about protecting these services to the vulnerable.  Groups showed interest in the idea of closing a city prison. Many citizens rallied to the notion that enough nonviolent offenders could be released (or alternatively sentenced in the first place) to free up space to bring back all the prisoners now housed, expensively, at suburban jails – or even to close one prison. Citizens uniformly did not want re-entry or job training services cut; they wanted fewer nonviolent offenders in jail. This idea was also considered strongly by a number of groups that ended up not voting for it.  Support for wage tax increases was strikingly strong. Most of it came near the end of the evening, when people realized they had taken more points off the board than they had put up. This is when, for many citizens, the difficulty of the task of actually having to balance a budget in the real world really hit home.  Sales tax increases also got a fair amount of the same kind of last-minute support. Hikes in parking and amusement taxes tended to be earlier slam dunks.  Meanwhile, raising business taxes generated little enthusiasm. These taxes were discussed only in a slim minority of groups. The notion that the gross receipts portion of the business privilege tax is unfair and unwieldy seems to have trickled down to the grass roots. A fair amount of grousing could be heard about suburban companies and banks in general not paying their proper share of the BPT.After the deliberation, the participants were given the option of recording video clips were they could speak for 2 minutes about topics close to their hearts. The Wailing Wall was a board where citizens can post complaints, concerns, or suggestions that they have regarding the current crisis or budget process.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The forum process lead to positive deliberation where citizens had the ability to discuss issues that matter. Having professionals moderate the tables helped keep the dialogue going and made sure all the voices were heard. One criticism is many of the reports talked about how activists were looked down upon. For example, one stated, ""a lot of citizen energy was distracted into chasing fantasies and phantoms churned up by activists who insisted that certain easy fixes”; these kinds of comments can take away from deliberation. People who have more “radical” views are often looked down upon when they can help find solutions even if they are thinking more outside the box. If citizens are working on the budget, they might find solutions that the people in power would not like.

[1] The recession also left California with a looming deficit crisis, forcing local communities to provide many social services that had been previously covered by the state. Unemployment meanwhile remained around 11%.With difficult decisions around how to develop a balanced budget, ""Daly City sought to educate and involve residents through a deliberative process designed to identify community values and priorities that would determine funding levels for city programs and services."" [1]  Daly City officials had multiple concrete objectives in mind when designing their  participatory budgeting  framework. First, they hoped for some direct information and guidance from residents about which services and facilities they valued most. Second, they wanted to highlight the fundamental tradeoffs which were inevitably hard to reconcile, especially given the city's needs and limited resources. Third, they hoped to glean new ideas about how to minimize expenses. Fourth, city officials saw the deliberative forums as an effective way of raising public awareness about the budget and the budget-setting process. Finally, by turning the process into a collaborative experience, it was hoped that Daly City would increase public approval of the budget decisions that were ultimately made.  Background History and ContextKnow what events led up to this initiative? Help uscomplete this section!Organizing, Supporting, and Funding Entities  The community budget forums were organized by Daly City officials. Each of the forums ""was hosted by the city manager and city staff in conjunction with a neutral third party facilitator from the non-profit Peninsula Conflict Resource Center,"" who trained community members in facilitation.[1]  Participant Recruitment and Selection  A total of about 270 residents participated in the forums.[1] Participation in the community forums was open and self-selected. Community members were informed of and invited to partake in the process via a special edition of the city community newsletter, containing extensive information on city revenue sources, services, and spending.[1] Included in this newsletter and also posted on the city website was a mail-in  survey  designed to gather informed opinions from those not attending the deliberative forums. The survey was made available in Tagalog, Spanish, and Chinese, so that residents still learning English could participate[1] and flyers promoting the forums in multiple languages were distributed to local community organizations and libraries.  Methods and Tools Used  Generally speaking, this initiative is an example of  participatory budgeting , a method of democratic innovation broadly described as ""a decision-making process through which citizens deliberate and negotiate over the distribution of public resources."" There are many benefits associated with participatory budgeting including increased  civic  and  democratic  education; increased government transparency; and an increased opportunity for participation by historically marginalized populations.[2]  Specific to this case was the use of  public hearings  used to allow citizens to learn about the budgeting process and to question public officials. As well,  small group deliberations  with facilitators allowed participants to brainstorm and discuss priorities and provide suggestions. Finally,  surveys  were used to measure public opinion which in turn influenced the city's final decisions.  What Went On: Process, Interaction, and Participation  “We want to know what you place the highest value on so we can take that into consideration when preparing the budget,” Daly City Manager Pat Martel told fifty diverse residents who turned out for a Thursday evening community conversation in October of 2009. [3]  The city held four public forums over the course of five weeks in the fall of 2009 ""in various parts of town and at different times - half were held during the day on Saturdays and half on weekday evenings."" [1] The third-party facilitator trained those community members who were graduates of the city’s citizen academy or members of city commissions, committees and boards so that they were able to act as small group facilitators and could  record the input shared by participants. The ""forums began with a welcome and background information on the city’s financial situation from Martel, followed by a visual presentation by City Finance Director Don McVey."" [1] Participants were offered the opportunity to  ask city staff in attendance direct questions , and attendees also discussed priorities in small groups while a volunteer facilitator recorded their inputs on flip charts. Attendees deliberated on the qualities of a good community as well as which city services they were and were not willing to see reduced. [1]  The opinion surveys and public deliberations stressed the city's compromised fiscal situation as well as the tradeoffs that would eventually need to be made. Participants were requested to select the five most important factors in evaluating their quality of life, out of a list including but not limited to transportation, library services, public safety, quality of schools, community amenities, cleanliness of public areas, infrastructure, sense of community, and recreational programs. Moreover, the survey asked participants to list which services they would be willing to give up or see reduced in exchange for their top three priorities. Important budget information was also distributed, such as the fact that only 17% of property tax dollars actually went to funding Daly City services and programs (with the remaining amount being diverted to California schools, San Mateo county, and redevelopment).  Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  “We will track the trends we see in the input from these meetings and the survey as well as an ongoing facilitated employee engagement process and make a presentation to the city council in December on what we have learned,” Martel told the meeting participants.[1] With a total of over 270 residents participating in the community forums and over 1300 surveys received, the council obtained valuable information about the priorities of their constituents to inform the difficult decisions and necessary trade-offs of producing a city budget. [1] Martel noted thatThe most useful part was hearing what the public had to say in the absence of public officials. They were comfortable enough to feel free to offer suggestions... it will be a little easier for council to make hard decisions about reducing services since we heard from our public engagement process that people were willing to accept certain trade-offs to make sure that their highest priority services and programs would not be affected by the budget reduction. [1]  Martel expressed that she was encouraged by the high level of participation and ""that more than the ‘usual suspects’ came out to participate"" in the community conversations; she declared that the city will continue to pursue public engagement and community building processes that inform residents and encourage them to participate in constructive dialogues around other issues. [1]  The city found the forums ""successful in validating the values, needs and priorities of [Daly City's] residents."" [4] As a result of the forums' findings, Daly City's budgeting committee eliminated all discretionary spending and focused on providing core services. In addition, twenty-two vacant government positions were permanently cut.  Analysis and Lesson Learned  City Manager, Pat Martel, isolated the following key lessons learned from the process. First, ""having public meetings in an environment less intimidating than a city council meeting, facilitated by residents who were commissioners or citizen academy graduates rather than city staff, created an equal playing field for a community conversation where the public was willing to weigh in on some tough questions in a very productive way."" [1] Second, the lesson learned was that deliberative public engagement ""can be useful"" and that Daly City should continue to have this community building process. [1] Third, it is less effective when participants come in with a strong position and are unwilling to yield. Thus, having a dialogue where city officials just listen as opposed to trying to lead the discussion can go further in terms of empowering the community to have an opportunity to help shape the outcome.  Overall, the Daly City participatory budgeting forums were viewed as successful. The municipality has plans to continue engaging the public on matters relating to the budget and other issues.
